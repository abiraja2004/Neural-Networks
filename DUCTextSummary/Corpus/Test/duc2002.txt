0.461538461538462	3	Gilbert also buffeted the Cayman Islands, but no deaths were reported.
0.166666666666667	4	Hurricane Gilbert's growth from a harmless low pressure zone off Africa to a ferocious killer in the Gulf of Mexico was fueled by a combination of heat, moisture and wind that baffles forecasters.
0	4	It's a matter of getting everything together in the right place in the right time, Gil Clark of the National Hurricane Center said Thursday.
0	4	It doesn't happen very often.
0	4	How it develops, we don't know.
0	4	Gilbert came to the attention of center forecasters Sept. 3 as a dry low pressure trough moving west out of Africa.
0	4	We get 50 or 60 of these off Africa every summer.
0	4	About one of six develop, said Clark.
0	4	By Sept. 8, the system became a depression.
0.25	4	It reached tropical storm status by Saturday and a hurricane Sunday.
0	4	A tropical wave becomes a depression when winds start swirling.
0.3	4	When sustained winds reach 39 mph, the system becomes a named tropical storm.
0	4	It reaches hurricane status when sustained winds hit 74 mph.
0.0576923076923077	4	Why Gilbert organized and strengthened while other systems didn't is a mystery more or less, said University of Miami meteorology Professor Rainer Bleck.
0	4	The first part of the summer we were biting our nails, wondering why these disturbances didn't develop, he said Thursday.
0	4	That's something meteorologists would like to know more about.
0	4	But the scientists do know what fuels a budding storm once development begins.
0	4	And they know that development is sparked when winds converge, and that growth is affected by time and place.
0	4	If that happens in an area where there's plenty of moisture in the lower atmosphere this convergence may lead to upward motion and cloud formation, Bleck said.
0	4	If clouds form, the heat of condensation in the clouds occasionally provides feedback' to the convergence pattern.
0	4	That strengthens it, he said, adding that storms can begin budding only off the equator because of the Earth's rotation.
0	4	Eventually, a vortex is created.
0	4	Any time you contract an air mass, they will start spinning.
0.0833333333333333	4	That's what makes the tornadoes, hurricanes and blizzards, those winter storms, Bleck said.
0	4	Hurricanes are useful to the climate machine.
0	4	Their primary role is to transport heat from the lower to the upper atmosphere, he said.
0	4	The sun puts energy into the water, the top of the oceans and lowest part of the atmosphere.
0	4	That has to be distributed from the bottom to higher levels of the atmosphere.
0	4	When the depression that would become Gilbert neared Barbados, warm Atlantic waters nurtured it.
0	4	This time of year in the northwest Caribbean is best for development, Clark said.
0	4	If you get a storm in this area in September, when the water's warmest, it can just explode.
0.15	4	This is where Camille formed and exploded, referring to the 1969 storm that slammed into the Gulf Coast.
0	4	It is an exciting thing to watch.
0.075	4	If you're on the beach watching the storm surge, it's a different story, he said.
0.24	4	The hurricane center said Gilbert was the most intense storm on record in terms of barometric pressure, measured at 26.13 inches Tuesday night.
0	4	That broke the 26.35 inches of the 1935 hurricane that devastated the Florida Keys.
0.568965517241379	5	Hurricane Gilbert swept toward Jamaica yesterday with 100-mile-an-hour winds, and officials issued warnings to residents on the southern coasts of the Dominican Republic, Haiti and Cuba.
0.3	5	The storm ripped the roofs off houses and caused coastal flooding in Puerto Rico.
0.3	5	In the Dominican Republic, all domestic flights and flights to and from Puerto Rico and Miami were canceled.
0.146341463414634	5	Forecasters said the hurricane was gaining strength as it passed over the ocean and would dump heavy rain on the Dominican Republic and Haiti as it moved south of Hispaniola, the Caribbean island they share, and headed west.
0	5	still gaining strength.
0.0416666666666667	5	It's certainly one of the larger systems we've seen in the Caribbean for a long time," said Hal Gerrish, forecaster at the National Hurricane Center in Coral Gables, Fla.
0.107142857142857	5	At 3 p.m. EDT, the center of the hurricane was about 100 miles south of the Dominican Republic and 425 miles east of Kingston, Jamaica.

0.111111111111111	5	Three people were injured in Guayanilla, Puerto Rico, when a tree fell on their vehicle as they traveled along Route 97, police reported.
0.25	5	Four policemen stationed on Mona Island, between Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic, were stranded as a result of the weather.

The California earthquake of Oct. 17 , 1989 caused extensive damage . Despite heavy insurance losses , insurance company stocks posted gains as investors bet on increases in insurance rates producing a long-term increase in profits . In Washington , the White House appeared hyperactive , anxious to show its responsiveness to the disaster . In Sacramento , Governor Deukmejian called a special session of the legislature to deal with the crisis . Critics accused him of blaming others for the collapse of freeways and called on him to get on with reconstruction and a temporary increase of the gasoline tax so hundreds of thousands of commuters could get to work . 
In the aftermath of California 's earthquake Tuesday , the White House reacted quickly to get federal aid flowing . The governor of California assured victims the state also would provide aid . Only about 25-30 % of homes in the San Francisco area are said to be insured . Insurers may have to pay billions of dollars for the earthquake but no company is expected to suffer serious financial damage . Insurers as a whole are likely to increase the amount of reinsurance they buy which , in turn , will translate into an overall price rise , thus ending the price-cutting war between them the past two years .

0.566666666666667	2	Gov. George Deukmejian is right to call the Legislature into special session within the next two weeks to deal with the effects of last Tuesday's Northern California earthquake.
0.086734693877551	2	With Congress already moving to grant up to $3 billion in relief, earthquake victims need to know that state officials are prepared to come up with the state's share of disaster and reconstruction aid as soon as possible, and as soon as is practical.
0	2	Deukmejian should be commended, as well, for advising state officials to do all they can to expedite aid to earthquake victims without getting too tangled up in red tape.
0.184782608695652	2	The governor is wrong, however, in his campaign to distance himself from the California Department of Transportation on the issue of what caused the Nimitz Freeway in Oakland to collapse, and what could or should have been done to have prevented it.
0	2	While Deukmejian is not necessarily blaming Caltrans, he seems to be preparing himself for such investigatory questions as: did you know and when did you know it?"
0.121428571428571	2	The governor's answer, which he has been repeating ever since the day of the quake, was that no one in Caltrans ever told him a freeway might collapse in an earthquake.
0	2	He was shocked that such a thing would happen.
0.114864864864865	2	This has the earmarks of a preemptive defense against any allegation that California stinted on highway reinforcement because transportation funds have been short during his administration, possibly because he had opposed a gasoline tax increase.
0	2	There is keen interest, of course, in why the freeway collapsed, and whether something might have been done.
0	2	The major reason is so that California can learn from the experience as it designs new roads and reinforces existing ones against the next quake.
0.425	2	There has been no widespread outcry against the governor.
0.293103448275862	2	While the Department of Transportation and the state Transportation Commission do exercise considerable control over the allocation of highway funds, the governor also sets general state priorities.
0.163461538461538	2	The governor complained on Sunday that the highway engineers never came to him and told him that bridges or freeways might collapse in an earthquake.
0	2	But no one who has lived in California more than a few months would rule out the chance that any bridge or freeway could collapse in the right kind of earthquake.
0	2	California is on the edge of earthquake-related technology, but still does not know everything that needs to be known.
0.554347826086957	2	The state learns more from every earthquake and a critical need now is to learn everything possible from Tuesday, Oct. 17.
0	2	But it is also the time to concentrate on helping quake victims through these most trying days of their experience the period when the emergency response is over and people face the dreary details of restoring their life to some kind of normality.
0.758928571428572	2	In the Bay Area, that includes hundreds of thousands of commuters who did not suffer personal damage, but face massive obstacles in getting to work.
0.607142857142857	2	The governor and legislative leaders will meet again next Monday to determine the timing and agenda of a special session.
0.62962962962963	2	It almost certainly would include a temporary gasoline-tax increase to deal with highway reconstruction and repair and possible general revenues for other forms of disaster relief.
0.163461538461538	2	Existing law already gives the governor considerable discretion in diverting reserve funds on hand to the Office of Emergency Services for allocation to local governments.
0	2	But the need could well exceed the present reserve.
0.653846153846154	2	The scope of the disaster would seem to justify a temporary surcharge.
0.118055555555556	2	The governor and Legislature should not wait too long to start the session, although they do not yet have precise damage estimates or know just how much the federal government will send to California.
0	2	The Legislature can begin organizing its staff and committees now so the appropriate legislation can be passed as soon as that information is obtained.
0.53125	3	The White House is making sure nobody will accuse it of taking this crisis lightly.
0.739130434782609	3	In the aftermath of the California earthquake, President Bush and his aides flew into a whirlwind of earthquake-related activity yesterday morning.
0.293103448275862	3	Some of it was necessary to get federal help flowing to victims, but some seemed designed mostly to project an image of a White House in action.
0	3	Mr. Bush and his aides were accused of responding too slowly after the Exxon Valdez oil tanker split open in Alaskan waters and Hurricane Hugo struck the Carolina coast, and they clearly don't want a repeat of those charges now.
0.326923076923077	3	So the White House announced that Mr. Bush got his first earthquake briefing of the day at 6:30 a.m. from chief of staff John Sununu.
0	3	By noon, Mr. Bush had taken two phone calls from Vice President Dan Quayle, who was in California; made a televised statement of concern; signed a disaster proclamation; received a written report from the Federal Emergency Management Agency; and visited FEMA headquarters.
0	3	Mr. Bush himself essentially acknowledged that he and his aides were trying to head off criticism.
0	3	On his FEMA visit, Mr. Bush said that he hoped there would be carping" about the emergency office's performance this time, adding that the agency a hit" for its reaction to Hurricane Hugo.
1	3	The White House already is talking of Mr. Bush visiting the California earthquake site this weekend.
0	3	He visited the Hugo devastation but not until after local leaders urged him to do so.
0.85	4	Insurers face the prospect of paying out billions of dollars for damages caused by this week's California earthquake.
0	4	Getting a grip on the extent of the damages is proving a far more difficult task than what insurers faced after Hurricane Hugo ripped through the Caribbean and the Carolinas last month.
0.10625	4	The earthquake's toll, including possible deep structural damage, goes far beyond the more easily observed damage from a hurricane, says George Reider, a vice president in Aetna Life Casualty Insurance Co.'s claims division.
0.354166666666667	4	But investors are betting that the financial and psychological impact of the earthquake, coming so soon after the hurricane, will help stem more than two years of intense price-cutting wars among business insurers.
0.425	4	Reflecting that logic, insurance-company stocks posted strong gains.
0.265625	4	Aetna and other insurers are hiring engineers and architects to help them assess structural damage.
0	4	Most insurers already have mobilized their teams to begin processing claims from their policyholders in northern California.
0	4	Since commercial air travel is interrupted, Aetna, based in Hartford, Conn., chartered three planes to fly claims adjusters into Sacramento and then planned for them to drive to the Bay area.
0	4	About 25 adjusters were dispatched yesterday afternoon, along with laptop computers, cellular phones and blank checks.
0.283333333333333	4	Some adjusters, already in other parts of California, drove to the disaster area with recreational vehicles and mobile homes that could be used as makeshift claims-processing centers.
0	4	Insurers will be advertising 800 numbers probably on the radio that policyholders can call to get assistance on how to submit claims.
0.283333333333333	4	State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co., the largest home and auto insurer in California, believes the losses from the earthquake could be somewhat less than the $475 million in damages it expects to pay out for claims resulting from Hurricane Hugo.
0	4	State Farm, based in Bloomington, Ind., is also the largest writer of personal-property earthquake insurance in California.
0	4	Earthquake insurance is sold as a separate policy or a specific endorsement on a homeowner's policy in California, because of the area's vulnerability to earthquakes.
0.25	4	State Farm said about 25% of its policyholders in California have also purchased earthquake insurance.
0.25	4	Allstate Insurance Co., a unit of Sears, Roebuck Co., said about 23% of its personal property policyholders about 28% in the San Franciso area also have earthquake coverage.
0.265625	4	The Association of California Insurance Companies estimated damage to residential property could total $500 million, but only $100 million to $150 million is insured, it said.
0.121428571428571	4	Officials from the American Insurance Association's property-claim service division, which coordinates the efforts of the claims adjusters in an area after a natural disaster, will be flying to San Francisco today.
0.265625	4	They expect to have a preliminary estimate of the damages in a day or two.
0.236111111111111	4	Roads and bridges in the Bay area appear to have suffered some of the most costly damage.
0	4	Highways, such as the section of Interstate 880 that collapsed in Oakland, generally don't have insurance coverage.
0	4	Industry officials say the Bay Bridge unlike some bridges has no earthquake coverage, either, so the cost of repairing it probably would have to be paid out of state general operating funds.
0	4	However, the bridge, which charges a $1 toll each way, does have of income" insurance to replace lost revenue if the operation of the bridge is interrupted for more than seven days.
0.141666666666667	4	That coverage is provided by a syndicate of insurance companies including Fireman's Fund Corp., based in Novato, Calif., and Cigna Corp., based in Philadelphia.
0.236111111111111	4	Earthquake-related claims aren't expected to cause significant financial problems for the insurance industry as a whole.
0.236111111111111	4	Instead, even with the liabilities of two natural disasters in recent weeks, analysts said the total capital of the industry is likely to be higher at year end than it was at midyear.
0.223684210526316	4	Indeed, the earthquake could contribute to a turnaround in the insurance cycle in a couple of ways.
0.965909090909091	4	For example, insurers may seek to limit their future exposure to catastrophes by increasing the amount of reinsurance they buy.
0.782894736842105	4	Such increased demand for reinsurance, along with the losses the reinsurers will bear from these two disasters, are likely to spur increases in reinsurance prices that will later be translated into an overall price rise.
0	4	Reinsurance is protection taken out by the insurance firms themselves.
0.101190476190476	4	are saying this is the breaking point, this is the event that will change the psychology of the marketplace," said William Yankus, an analyst with Conning Co., a Hartford firm that specializes in the insurance industry.
0	4	His firm, along with some others, issued new buy recommendations on insurer stocks yesterday.
0	4	Among the insurance stocks, big gainers included American International Group, up $3.25 to $102.625; General Re Corp., up $2.75 to $86.50; Aetna, up $2.375 to $59.50; and Marsh McLennan Inc., up $3.125 to $75.875.
0	4	Still, a few individual companies, most likely smaller ones, could be devastated.
0	4	think there is a damned good chance someone is going to hit the skids on this," said Oppenheimer Co. analyst Myron Picoult.
0	4	He suspects some insurers who had purchased reinsurance to limit their exposure to catastrophes will discover that reinsurance was used up by Hurricane Hugo.
0.579545454545454	4	British, West German, Scandinavian and other overseas insurers are bracing for big claims from the San Francisco earthquake disaster.
0	4	Although it's unclear how much exposure the London market will face, U.K. underwriters traditionally have a large reinsurance exposure to U.S. catastrophe coverage.
0	4	Jack Byrne, chairman of Fireman's Fund, said this disaster will test the catastrophe reinsurance market, causing these rates to soar.
0.146551724137931	4	The catastrophe losses sustained by insurers this year will probably be the worst on an inflation-adjusted basis since 1906 when another earthquake sparked the Great San Francisco Fire.
0.137096774193548	4	Orin Kramer, an insurance consultant in New York, estimates that the 1906 San Francisco destruction, on an inflation-adjusted basis, included insured losses of $5.8 billion.
0	4	He is estimating this week's disaster will generate insured losses of $2 billion to $4 billion, following about $4 billion in costs to insurers from Hurricane Hugo.

0	3	She called it a deeply serious outrage.
0	3	King visited the scene soon after the explosion.
0	3	I know that the people who committed it, the godfathers who sent them, actually know in their hearts that it is not going to make any difference; that it is just killing for the sake of killing, he said.
0	3	The defense minister, anger clearly written on his face, said that rather than erode the will of the security forces, the attack redoubles their determination to ensure that terrorism cannot win.

0	4	It appears the men left several days before the explosion.
0.096969696969697	4	He said the house, which overlooks the barracks recreation center destroyed by the Friday morning blast, was rented by its English owners to three men for two to three weeks.
0	4	There was no proof the house was an IRA hideout, the commander said.
0	4	By virtue of the fact that the house is very near the base and the men are Irish, we are very anxious to talk to them, he said.

0	5	It is important to remember that what we need in these cases are eyes and ears and observation, King said on British Broadcasting Corp. radio.
0.145454545454545	5	Private security guards can be a very useful additional assistance.
0	5	They also help to reduce the amount of time soldiers have to spend on what is not the most enjoyable part of their activity.
0	5	At church services throughout the small port, clergymen urged mourners to pray for and forgive the bombers.
0	5	The Rev. Charles Howard, a Royal Navy chaplain, asked the 300-member congregation inside the barracks, if you can find room in your hearts pray for the men who perpetrated this terrible act, that God will soften their hearts and turn them from their violent and evil ways.

0	2	Accordions played folk songs and women in traditional costumes danced with cartoon characters, including Mickey Mouse and Baba Yaga, a witch of Russian fairy tales.
0	2	One Muscovite, accustomed to clerks who snarl if they say anything at all, asked for a straw and was startled when a smiling young Soviet woman found him one and popped it straight into his drink.
0	2	For most customers, it was their first experience with a hamburger.
0.148571428571429	2	Sandwiches were served in the familiar bag marked with the golden arches, but were packed in wrappers bearing Cyrillic letters, approximating gamburger.
0	2	They tried them one-handed.
0	2	They picked their sandwiches apart to examine the contents.
0	2	One young woman finally squashed her Beeg Mak to fit her lips around it.
0	2	It tasted great!
0	2	a 14-year-old boy said.
0	2	It's a lot different from a stolovaya, he continued with a smile, referring to the much cheaper but run-down dirty cafeterias that slop rice and fat or boiled sausage.
0.135064935064935	2	Under the sign of the golden arches, accented by the Soviet hammer-and-sickle flag, hundreds lined up for the long-awaited grand opening at 10 a.m. on Pushkin Square, reaching out excitedly for McDonald's flags and pins as the hamburger chain's army fulfilled the Soviet penchant for souvenirs with Western logos.
0	2	Publicity-conscious managers had the staff shout Good morning, America!
0	2	in English and Russian, for an American TV network.
0.0977443609022556	2	McDonald's of Canada Chairman George Cohon, the man behind the deal, said many people were buying multiple orders and the restaurant served 15,000 to 20,000 people in just the first five hours of operation.
0.232142857142857	2	The restaurant limited purchases to 10 Big Macs per customer in hopes of preventing burger-scalping.
0.0844155844155844	2	McDonald's built its own factory, including bakery, dairy, meat-processing plant and even potato storage yard, to provide its own guaranteed supplies in a country where up to 25 percent of the harvest rots en route to the consumer.
0.103174603174603	2	One McDonald's associate said the company wound up importing wooden crates from Finland for storing potatoes because when they went to build crates, they found there was no wood, and no nails.
0	2	They found you need a permit to buy nails.
0.371428571428571	3	McDonald's hamburgers, fries and golden arches came to China on Monday when the fast-food chain opened its first restaurant in a nation famed for its distinctive cuisine.
0.65546218487395	3	Hundreds of Chinese waited for hours outside the restaurant in Shenzhen, an economic boom town near Hong Kong, for their first taste of a McDonald's hamburger, fries or shake.
0	3	I travelled for four hours from a village to get here, said Huang Rongti, 70, who has lost most of her teeth because of age.
0	3	You think hamburgers are too challenging for my age?
0.206349206349206	3	Later, after purchasing her first Big Mac, she inspected it carefully before taking a bite.
0	3	It tastes good, I like it, she announced before slowly eating the rest.
1	3	The opening of a U.S. fast-food restaurant in China, where cooking has long been considered a culinary art, may seem odd to gourmets.
0	3	It is estimated there are more than 5,000 different Chinese dishes.
0	3	In Canton, 125 miles northwest of Shenzhen, chefs specialize in some of the more exotic Chinese dishes, such as cat stew, bear paws, chicken feet and a famed snake dish Dragon and Tiger Locked in Battle made from three kinds of poisonous snakes stewed with leopard meat, and garnished with 20 spices, lemon leaves and chrysanthemum petals.
0.154761904761905	3	However, many Chinese, who earn an average $32 a month, are still unable to afford fancy meals at restaurants.
0	3	In Shenzhen, a Chinese special economic zone where foreign investors have built factories, salaries are higher and workers earn an average of $53 a month.
0	3	At the restaurant, a Big Mac costs $1.14, a bag of fries 48 cents and a shake 74 cents.
0.142857142857143	3	Another U.S. fast food outlet, Kentucky Fried Chicken, opened a restaurant in Beijing in 1987, and it now has four outlets there.
0.675324675324675	3	McDonald's hopes to open a restaurant in Beijing later.
0.109243697478992	3	Although Kentucky Fried Chicken has become popular, the average Chinese still regards a meal there as a treat, rather than a convenience, and McDonald's could face the same problems.
0.530612244897959	3	The 500-seat McDonald's restaurant in a three-story building is operated by McDonald's Restaurant Shenzhen Ltd., a wholly owned subsidiary of McDonald's Hong Kong.
0.873949579831933	3	McDonald's Hong Kong is a 50-50 joint venture with McDonald's in the United States.
0	3	It is managed by a Chinese national, Chen Tikang, and his son, Chen Yin, who is the restaurant manager.
0.195488721804511	3	The younger Chen returned recently from a course at McDonald's hamburger university in Oak Brook, Ill.
0.247619047619048	3	Most of the ingredients used at the restaurant are now imported from Hong Kong.
0.436974789915966	3	But McDonald's executives hope eventually to get their supplies of beef and potatoes from China.
0.206349206349206	3	Daniel Ng, chairman of McDonald's Restaurant Shenzhen Ltd., said it took two years to prepare for the restaurant's opening and his ambition now is to serve 10 million burgers a year.
0.123809523809524	3	Last month, when McDonald's advertized for 240 staffers for the restaurant, it received applications from more than 9,000 persons, including college graduates, officials said.
0	3	I feel I have a better job prospect working here, and it pays better, said Henry He, 25, who has a master's degree in garment and textile.
0.412698412698413	3	He is an assistant manager at the restaurant.
0	3	A waiter at the restaurant can earn 53 cents an hour.
0	3	A factory worker, who waited several hours before she was able to purchase her hamburger, said she liked it because of its sweet taste the result of tomato ketchup, which is not commonly used in traditional Chinese cooking.
0.103174603174603	4	AS THE value of the rouble plunges and potential foreign investors worry about a host of obstacles to investing in Russia, Russian officials had several reasons yesterday to feel thankful for McDonald's hamburgers.
0.452961672473868	4	Opening the second McDonald's restaurant in Moscow, along with a 12-storey office block, Mr George Cohon, head of McDonald's Canada, could well be described as the Russian authorities' idea of a model investor.
0.181184668989547	4	McDonald's proven determination be here for the long term' and to serve Russians in their own currency as opposed to the dollars charged by most other foreign joint ventures are just a couple of reasons for Russian gratitude.
0.112554112554113	4	Mr Viktor Khlystun, the agriculture minister, praised the fact that McDonald's gets most of its supplies from inside Russia after setting up a Dollars 45m processing plant outside Moscow.
0.218487394957983	4	He also thanked McDonald's for providing jobs, a model of western standards for the country's decrepit service industry, and finally for what he described as most delicious food'.
0.431893687707641	4	But despite the jolly opening ceremony with Big Macs, musicians playing the balalaika, and hundreds of yellow balloons forming a giant M life has been tough for McDonald's since it opened its first restaurant in Moscow 3 1/2 years ago.
0.145658263305322	4	Although the first Moscow restaurant is the busiest McDonald's in the world the plunging rouble, high inflation and constantly changing tax rules have been a challenge to McDonald's management, who admitted that they have no idea of when it could recoup its initial Dollars 50m investment.
0	4	will depend on how rapidly we can open new restaurants, what happens to the rouble, what happens to raw materials that we buy.
0	4	We don't have an estimate of how long it will take.
0	4	There are too many variables,' said Mr Cohon.
0.0977443609022556	4	Apart from housing the restaurant on the ground floor, the McDonald's office block is rented out to western companies in an attempt to generate hard currency alongside the mountains of roubles made from selling hamburgers.
0.422077922077922	5	When the doors swung open Wednesday at the first McDonald's restaurant in the Soviet Union, thousands of Muscovites poured in to sip cocktails" and taste their first Mak Gamburgers," picking them apart to marvel at the fixin's.
0.0977443609022556	5	Some expressed wonder at the speedy service an hour in line" while others heralded the event as the first evidence that President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's economic reforms are finally filtering down to the average Muscovite.
0.0825396825396826	5	Although cynics might complain of the steady homogenizing of world cultures, the arrival of the fast-food chain here 14 years after a Canadian McDonald's official broached the idea with Soviet officials at the 1976 Montreal Olympics was without doubt a major event.
0.464285714285714	5	Most customers seemed thrilled to be part of it, even though some of them gave the Big Mac sandwich a mixed review.
0	5	tasted very, I would say, unusual," Lubov Sereda, 45, said with a smile.
0	5	was very soft and mild."
0	5	those strawberry milk cocktails, well. her husband put in, flashing a thumbs-up sign.
0	5	was very interesting, that gamburger," Zvetlana Generotova, 25, said, leaving with a large paper bag filled with take-out food, also a new concept here.
0	5	certainly want my family to try it, at least once."
0	5	Russians say because they pronounce Western words that begin with as though they begin with
0	5	Another customer, Victor Kunyasev, said: my wife makes better food.
0	5	But it was nice, a good place to take a break and grab a bite to eat."
0.168831168831169	5	Some reported waiting up to 1 hour and 45 minutes to be served, but most did not seem to mind.
0.0977443609022556	5	In honor of the grand opening, a brigade of workers distributed McDonald's flags and pins; entertainers performed on the accordion and sang folk songs under golden arches adorned with the Soviet hammer and sickle.
0.293233082706767	5	The world's largest McDonald's, with 27 cash registers and a seating capacity of 900, brings to Moscow not only hamburgers, french fries and shakes but also a living lesson in Western-style marketing.
0	5	At training sessions before opening day, cashiers were taught the importance of greeting customers cheerfully, of saying and you" all of which promises something distinctly different from the typically surly service at most of Moscow's dingy state cafes.
0	5	is very different from anything I've ever done before," cashier Larissa Lebedeva said.
0	5	Lebedeva, 25, who formerly worked as deputy director of a small food store, said that be this polite and to have everything this clean is new for the workers as well as for the customers."
0.161490683229814	5	Sam Yahel, from McDonald's in Atlanta, who helped train the 630 Soviet workers, said the Soviet trainees were at a disadvantage because in most other parts of the world, new workers had at least eaten at one of the restaurants.
0	5	Most of the Soviet workers had never tasted a Western-style hamburger.
0	5	They practiced cooking using yellow cardboard squares in place of cheese and different colored poker chips in place of onions, tomatoes and pickles.
0.30952380952381	5	Soviet Union is definitely a different world," Yahel said.
0	5	food and our standards it's all new.
0	5	For example, we had to teach our employees that when there were still crumbs on the counter, it needed to be wiped off again."
0	5	While most of the Soviet workers trained for a matter of days, the four Soviet managers of the restaurant spent nine months abroad learning their jobs.
0	5	They graduated from the Canadian Institute of Hamburgerology.
0.112554112554113	5	The Moscow McDonald's will be open for 12 hours a day beginning at 10 a.m. and will be able, they say, to serve more than 15,000 customers a day.
0.530612244897959	5	On Wednesday, though, it stayed open an extra two hours and served a McDonald's record 30,000 meals.
0	5	The previous record for opening-day transactions was 9,100 in Budapest, Hungary, and the previous record sales for a single day was 14,000 in Hong Kong.
0	5	There is a brass plaque near the entrance that announces, Rubles Only."
0.26530612244898	5	Virtually every other foreign firm that has come into the Soviet Union in recent years accepts only hard currencies, meaning that it caters primarily to foreigners.
0.161490683229814	5	The McDonald's prices are high compared to the state restaurants, where a large meal seldom costs more than a ruble.
0	5	The Big Mac costs 3.75 rubles, or about $5 at the official exchange rate, and dinner out for the family can come to two days' wages for the average Soviet worker.
0.137566137566138	5	McDonald's employees are paid 1.50 rubles an hour, with a chance for an increase of up to 50 kopecks in three months' time.
0	5	The staff was chosen from 25,000 applicants.
0	5	Canadian and American officials who have helped train the Soviet personnel know that the allure of working for a Western firm was a drawing factor, but they nonetheless expect a 20% turnover rate, twice their normal average.
0.119815668202765	5	McDonald's invested $50 million in setting up the restaurant and a food processing plant in a Moscow suburb that turns out everything from meat patties to sesame-seed buns.
0.154761904761905	5	Soviet farmers, who are supplying most of the products, have been given special training and disease-resistant seed for potatoes and cucumbers.
0	5	The extra effort was necessary to guarantee supplies in a country where as much as 25% of the harvest spoils on the way to the consumer.
0	5	Despite all of the planning, some shortages still affect the operation.
0	5	Coffee is not on the menu, for example, because supplies cannot be guaranteed.
0.278571428571429	5	The joint venture agreement between McDonald's of Canada and the Moscow City Council calls for 20 restaurants, though there is no timetable or even a definite plan for when or where the second McDonald's will open.
0	5	Is there any fear that when the golden arches become as common as the cupolas of Russian Orthodox churches, it will be a sign that capitalism is making real inroads in the Communist capital?
0.218487394957983	5	McDonald's officials say it is not a question that worries them or their Soviet counterparts.
0	5	weren't many ideological discussions during these negotiations," said Marc Winer, 43, a native of Nashua, N.H., who is general director of the Moscow outlet.
0	5	Soviets understood that the food was going to move very efficiently from the field to the mouth.
0	5	That is more important to them right now than almost anything else."
0	6	Two corporate executives sat down in an office here last month to talk business with a bunch of clowns.
0.185714285714286	6	The subject was no laughing matter, but rather the serious endeavor of finding South Korea's Ronald McDonald.
0.285714285714286	6	Seven years after the U.S. hamburger giant first tried to bring its Big Macs to South Korea, the golden arches were finally going up.
0.17687074829932	6	McAhn Industries Ltd. recently opened the first of what it expects will be a string of burger outlets in Seoul.
0.297142857142857	6	The company is a 50-50 joint venture of McDonald's Corp., Oak Brook, Ill., and an accountant-turned-entrepreneur, Ahn Hyo Young.
0.30952380952381	6	McDonald's is flourishing in 11 other nations in the region.
0.546218487394958	6	But its entry into South Korea, which has Asia's fastest-growing economy, had been frustrated by its inability to find a suitable partner and to win agreement from Seoul on terms.
0.218487394957983	6	South Korea may be one of McDonald's most promising foreign markets, business analysts say.
0.195488721804511	6	The country is developing an essential ingredient for the success of a fast-food enterprise: a middle class.
0.275132275132275	6	Hamburger-related fast-food sales in South Korea totaled $87.5 million last year, a 30% rise from 1986, according to the Ministry of Finance.
0	6	Analysts say this year's rise could be much bigger, helped by a 25% increase in wages in mid-1987 and another big pay increase expected soon.
0	6	The business is likely to profit from the 1988 Olympic Games in Seoul in September, and from an anticipated post-Olympic economic boom here.
0.168831168831169	6	However, the competition is heating up, and there is good possibility that South Korea already has reached the fast-food saturation point for its current average income bracket," an official for the South Korea Chamber of Commerce and Industry says.
0	6	The competition, besides Wendy's International's 11 shops and six of Burger King, a unit of Pillsbury Co., includes home-grown burger chains.
0.445714285714286	6	McDonald's strategy is to take things slowly, avoiding extravagances, Mr. Ahn and Awad Sifri, McDonald's marketing director, say.
0	6	are starting small," says Mr. Ahn.
0	6	hoping to open three outlets this year and five next year.
0	6	After that, we'd like to open five every year."
0	6	Equally modest, he says, will be the initial menu: no breakfast, no Chicken McNuggets and no products tailored to national tastes, as offered elsewhere.
0	6	The venture is rejecting television commercials in favor of a cheaper, more oldfashioned approach: a brief advertising campaign in newspapers, distribution of fliers and word of mouth.
0.436974789915966	6	Mr. Sifri says the emphasis will be on developing McDonald's image as an affordable place for the emerging middle class, rather than as a familiar name for foreigners in South Korea.
0	6	Attention will be given to attracting children, he adds.
0.206349206349206	6	Mr. Ahn says McDonald's talked to 16 potential partners before choosing the Harvard-trained accountant in 1984.
0.530612244897959	6	Two years later, McDonald's and Mr. Ahn each put up $1 million in capital and borrowed an additional $4 million to form McAhn.
0.13265306122449	6	McDonald's struggled with the government over McAhn's royalty payments to the U.S. partner the issue was resolved and over tight import restrictions on food products.
0.148571428571429	6	The import question down to finding a supplier locally who could supply high-quality beef and potatoes at a value," McDonald's said.
0.168831168831169	6	Even McDonald's golden arches symbol ran into red tape, since the city regulates the size and color of signs.
0	6	may be against the law, but we're putting them up anyway," Mr. Ahn says.

0.0902777777777778	1	Dan Quayle has not yet been nominated for vice president and already Republicans are comparing him to Thomas Jefferson and John F. Kennedy.
0.0570175438596491	1	Sen. John Warner of Virginia, who served with Quayle on a Senate subcommittee, told an audience that whenever he heard the Indiana senator speak, I'd say, stands the next Thomas Jefferson.'
0	1	And, added Warner, he does have the same fire in his belly as our great forefather Thomas Jefferson of Virginia.
0	1	Former president Gerald Ford made the comparison with Kennedy, a Democrat.
0.160493827160494	1	In 1960, the American people voted for John F. Kennedy for president and he was the relatively same age as Dan Quayle, said Ford.

0	1	But he doesn't like it when people say he looks like movie idol Robert Redford.
0	1	Whether, indeed, he looks like Redford seems to be in the eye of the beholder.
0	1	In the parlance of politics, it's an issue.
0	1	They are both male.
0	1	They are both blond.
0	1	The so-called resemblance became a point of contention in the 1980 Senate race and Redford took umbrage.
0	1	The actor, who once played the role of a presidential office seeker in The Candidate sent Quayle a telegram telling him to stop the look-alike references in his congressional campaign literature.
0.0833333333333333	1	Quayle said the news media had made the comparison, not he, and after he was elected sent Redford an autographed picture of himself.

0	1	To help him get known, eight fellow senators Wednesday took turns telling reporters how much they liked him.
0	1	We know him well, said Strom Thurmond, R-S.C. He's attractive because of his looks, he's attractive because of his enthusiasm, said Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz.
0.0722222222222222	1	I think Dan Quayle, although he's 41 years of age, he's going to send a message to the American people that the Republican Party respects young people who achieve, said Sen. Pete Domenici, R-N.M. Oh, yes, he's also rich, but the senators said that should not hold him back.
0	1	Let's not start this business of who's wealthy, Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y.
0.0698924731182796	2	Here is a transcript of the speech by Sen. Bob Dole of Kansas nominating Sen. Dan Quayle of Indiana for vice president at the Republican National Convention on Thursday night.
0	2	Mr. Chairman, four of my congressional colleagues and I are here for the purpose of nominating the next vice president of the United States.
0.12037037037037	2	We are here to nominate one of the bright young lights in the Republican Party, a man I am proud to say is my colleague, the junior senator from Indiana, Dan Quayle.
0	2	You know, senators get a lot of mail.
0	2	Party leaders more than most.
0	2	And almost every one of these letters asks for help with some problem.
0	2	Well, three years ago, I received a handwritten plea from a 6-year-old girl who after several days of long, long Senate sessions had a very special problem.
0	2	She wrote, and I quote: I have my second-grade play tonight.
0	2	Please make sure my daddy can come home and watch me.
0.114035087719298	2	I knew Corinne Quayle was from a political family because she invited me to come along, too.
0.0747126436781609	2	Corinne and her brothers, Tucker and Benjamin, and their mother, Marilyn, share Dan Quayle with the people of Indiana and the United States Senate.
1	2	Dan Quayle is a dedicated public servant and a devoted family man.
0	2	And whenever I needed him, whenever I needed him, Dan was there ready and willing to make the tough choices, to cast the tough votes, to transform President Reagan's vision of America into the law of the land.
0.131313131313131	2	Whether it was the budget or defense, tax reform or the INF treaty, Dan Quayle was there, a forceful advocate, and a staunch supporter of the Reagan revolution.
0	2	And now he is ready to carry that revolution forward.
0	2	And believe me he is ready, and just let the Democrats try to use experience as a measuring stick in this campaign.
0	2	Just let them try.
0	2	Now, I don't mean to suggest their presidential candidate lacks experience.
0.0528455284552845	2	He's got plenty of experience, plenty of experience experience in raising taxes again and again, experience in vetoing the pledge of allegiance in public schools, experience in increasing spending year after year after year in Massachusetts.
0	2	And I just don't believe the American people want that kind of experience in the White House.
0	2	It sounds like a Dukak-eyed idea to me.
0.481481481481481	2	But Dan Quayle's got experience, too.
0.127450980392157	2	He's already spent 12 years as a congressman and a senator, tackling the vital national and international issues that affect the lives of all Americans and the future of our country.
0	2	That is 12 more years of national experience than Michael Dukakis and he is running for president.
0.254901960784314	2	As I said at the start, Dan Quayle is a man I know and trust.
0	2	I am honored to nominate him for vice president, Mr. Chairman.
0.0677083333333333	2	And for the purpose of debate only, I yield the balance of my time to the outstanding, distinguished senior from Indiana, my good friend, Sen. Dick Lugar.
0.173333333333333	3	Dan Quayle's vice presidential nomination was supposed to be a triumph for the precocious young Indiana senator, but the dream faded overnight.
0.353741496598639	3	Bush's surprise choice for his running mate was supposed to ignite a campaign that has seemed at times to suffer from lack of inspiration, but he quickly encountered questions over his military record and suggestions he could best serve the Republicans by withdrawing from the ticket.
0	3	Though he found himself in danger of fizzling Thursday, Quayle managed to stir the convention hall with his upbeat speech about family, generations and the rosy future he foresaw under a Bush administration.
0	3	Let's go on to victory!
0	3	Quayle exhorted, as the crowd erupted in cheers.
0	3	The 41-year-old nominee delivered the speech with calm self-assurance, sticking close to his text and avoiding his penchant for extemporaneous remarks perhaps another result of the unanticipated controversy.
0.376811594202899	3	Bush, who followed his running mate to the podium, said he was proud to have Dan Quayle at my side.
0	3	The two will stress the unity of their ticket as they campaign together this weekend through Indiana, Ohio and Illinois.
0.108333333333333	3	But beyond the optimistic words was an unsettling undercurrent that threatened Quayle's candidacy just as it was launched.
0.212418300653595	3	Retired Maj. Gen. Wendell C. Phillippi who worked for Quayle's grandfather, Eugene C. Pulliam, as managing editor of The Indianapolis News said he contacted the National Guard on behalf of Quayle when the young man applied in 1969 and recommended him very highly, the News reported.
0.103174603174603	3	Quayle, a hardliner on defense matters, has said he sought guard duty so he could attend law school.
0.0541666666666667	3	A Bush aide said the matter was discussed with the Indiana senator during the process that led to his selection for the Bush ticket, and Quayle had denied that he used influence to gain admittance to the Guard.
0	3	Bush aides said no thought had been given to dropping Quayle from the ticket, as some Republicans suggested.
0.0984848484848485	3	Quayle was tense and refused to answer reporters' questions about the topic during a brief walk-through at the convention hall.
0	3	It was a daunting change for the senator, whose youthful vigor, rapid political rise, striking good looks and wealth have been compared to those of John F. Kennedy.
0.0984848484848485	3	Quayle alluded to the National Guard issue during his speech, saying he was proud of the six years he served.
0.12037037037037	3	He also addressed his relative anonymity: Many this week have asked, is Dan Quayle?'
0	3	The people of Indiana know me and now the nation will.
0	3	Those who addressed the convention on his behalf also pulled out their ammunition.
0.0698924731182796	3	Sen. Bob Dole of Kansas, who placed Quayle's name in nomination, stressed his campaign skills and sought to deflect concerns that he lacked experience for the job.
0.541666666666667	3	He's already spent 12 years as a congressman and senator.
0	3	That is 12 more years of national experience than Michael Dukakis, and he is running for president, Dole said.
0	3	Sen. Alan Simpson of Wyoming, one of those who seconded the nomination, said Quayle would bring vim, vigor and vitality to the party and would bring sparks and voltage to this campaign.
0	3	Whether Quayle can overcome his difficult start on the national ticket remains to be seen.
0	3	Others, notably Democratic vice presidential nominee Geraldine Ferraro in 1984, found they could not.
0.12037037037037	3	But Quayle, ever upbeat, was determined Thursday night not to be daunted by the prospect.
0	3	Miracles do happen, he told his party.
0.270833333333333	4	Republican vice presidential candidate Dan Quayle's official resume says he was the Indiana Consumer Protection Division's chief investigator a year before the unit was created, state records show.
0	4	The law creating the unit passed April 14, 1971, and took effect July 1.
0	4	Officials said Quayle served as chief investigator from July until mid-September, when he became administrative assistant to then-Gov.
0	4	Edgar D. Whitcomb.
0.318627450980392	4	Quayle's Senate biography, which his campaign is using as his official background, says he was chief investigator of the unit in the Attorney General's office from 1970 to 1971.
0	4	He was assigned to our section in the spring of 1971, said Robert Smith, the unit's first director and now an attorney in Indianapolis.
0	4	He was in fact the chief investigator.
0	4	He helped get the unit set up.
0	4	it would not have been before 1971, Smith said Friday in a telephone interview.
0	4	We formally began operations July 1.
0	4	Quayle conceded Friday that the resume entry was inaccurate and said his staff had written the document.
0	4	If it indicated that, that is inaccurate.
0	4	I didn't hold that job for two years, Quayle told reporters aboard his campaign plane.
0	4	Earlier, however, Quayle spokesman David Prosperi called the revelation of the error by The Plain Dealer of Cleveland a cheap shot.
0.382352941176471	4	Quayle was hired as an entry-level research assistant by the state Attorney General's office in 1970 after he returned from six months of basic and advanced training for the Indiana National Guard.
0.456140350877193	4	Quayle, a 1969 graduate of DePauw University, was attending Indiana University Law School at the time.
0	4	M. Stanton Evans, then an editor with the Indianapolis News, helped arrange his job interview with the state.
0.270833333333333	4	Evans worked for Eugene C. Pulliam, Quayle's grandfather and publisher of the News.
0.0503875968992248	4	At no point in any of this did Dan Quayle ask any favors or use any influence, said Evans, now with the National Journalism Center in Washington, D.C. He wouldn't have been hired as a chief investigator.
0	4	He was hired in an entry-level job and was promoted to a whole bunch of jobs on his merits.
0	4	It's a nothing story, Evans said.
0.0802469135802469	4	Theodore Sendak, the Attorney General at the time, recently had surgery and is unable to comment, according to his son, Timothy Sendak.
0	4	Patricia Gifford, a Marion Superior Court judge who was then an assistant attorney general, said Friday that prior to the establishment of the Consumer Protection Division, all complaints and inquiries were handled by me.
0.270833333333333	4	The legal assistant assigned to me and utilized as my chief investigator was Dan Quayle.
0	4	Her statement was released by the Quayle campaign.
0	4	The Consumer Protection Division was created by the state legislature to resolve complaints over defective products, false claims in ads, faulty speedometer readings and mail-order fraud.
0	4	In 1980, Quayle referred to himself as a Vietnam-era veteran in campaign literature when he was running against three-term incumbent Birch Bayh in a Senate race.
0.309523809523809	4	Quayle, who enlisted in the Indiana National Guard, dropped the reference after objections by some Vietnam combat veterans.
0	4	In that same election, which he won, Quayle said he was on active duty for several periods during his tenure in the Guard.
0.114035087719298	4	The statement referred to periods when Quayle was in basic training and 15 days of camp each summer.
0.247619047619048	5	Dan Quayle is likely to be a man on the outside in George Bush's White House following a vice presidential candidacy that began in a furor but settled into obscurity, experts say.
0	5	Encumbered by his image as a political novice who needed a bevy of professional handlers to survive early campaign controversies, Quayle enters a Bush administration in which he has few intimates or allies.
0.0884353741496599	5	Relegated in the campaign to small towns and safe GOP areas, Quayle as vice president is likely to be given a traditional ceremonial role going to political gatherings and state funerals rather than the advisory role that Walter Mondale and even Bush had, some scholars feel.
0.270833333333333	5	Dan Quayle is going to set the vice presidency back about a decade or more.
0	5	One thing that political scientists have been talking about is just how much the vice presidency has grown.
0.0528455284552845	5	With Quayle, it's just going to retreat to the old days of politics and funerals, said Ryan Barilleaux, a professor of political science at Miami University in Oxford, Ohio, who studies the American presidency.
0.196969696969697	5	Bush rarely mentioned his 41-year-old running mate during the campaign.
0.111111111111111	5	When asked, Bush employed the stock lines that Quayle would make an outstanding vice president and had been tempered by steel as he weathered the early furor over his military service, academic record and personal life.
0	5	The president-elect told reporters Quayle would have access to the same papers, information and intelligence that is available to the president.
0.144444444444444	5	But he would go no further in describing what assignments he would give Quayle.
0	5	Quayle says Bush has talked to him about heading a space council, and that he assumes he'll have a role in the administration's anti-drug efforts.
0	5	I will be a very close adviser to the president, Quayle said.
0	5	But that's not the way everyone sees it.
0	5	Both Bush and Mondale came to their vice presidential campaigns with substantial reputations and were able to place key staffers in important positions in the respective presidential campaigns, Barilleaux notes.
0.144444444444444	5	Dan Quayle has contributed nothing in the way of staff to the Bush campaign.
0	5	He doesn't have his own big reputation on Capitol Hill.
0.382352941176471	5	Dan Quayle has no friends in a Bush White House except George Bush, Barilleaux says.
0	5	They're going to give him a lot of window dressing, a space council, drug task force, but he's going to be a man on the outside not a man who's going to be consulted in a crisis, except on a pro forma basis.
0.0601851851851852	5	But Eddie Mahe Jr., a GOP consultant who worked with the Bush campaign, says Bush is likely to give Quayle a more active role in the administration than he had in the campaign.
0	5	Vindication demands that.
0	5	Both of them will want to prove how right the decision was, Mahe says.
0.139784946236559	5	Democrats portrayed Quayle during the campaign as a lightweight, a man with little or no legislative accomplishments, untested and unqualified to be a heartbeat away from the presidency.
0.577777777777778	5	Even some members of Quayle's own party were dismayed at Bush's choice.
0.0555555555555556	5	Quayle didn't help his case by making a number of celebrated gaffes during the campaign, perhaps the worst being his garbled explanation of the Holocaust and his declaration, I didn't live in this century.
0.0833333333333333	5	Norman Ornstein, of the American Enterprise Institute, says Quayle, while not the world's leading intellectual, is not a complete dummy.
0	5	He was simply thrust into a situation for which he was unprepared, Ornstein says.
0	5	I think he's immature.
0	5	He's not stupid, Ornstein says.
0.0541666666666667	5	But Quayle comes to the White House with a very damaging stereotype that's developed about him that's widely believed in the political community and that's believed by a large segment of the electorate, Ornstein says.
0	5	That's going to give him a good deal to overcome.
0	5	It's going to give him an enormous impetus to prove himself.
0	5	That's going to be difficult, given the office.
0.173333333333333	5	Both Barilleaux and Stephen Hess of the Brookings Institution see parallels in Quayle's vice presidency and those of Richard Nixon and Spiro Agnew.
0.224137931034483	5	The choice of Nixon was viewed as a move by Dwight Eisenhower to appease the party's right wing, and Agnew was seen as a political nonentity.
0	5	The natural response is to use him sparingly, as Nixon did with Agnew in 1968, Hess says.
0.0460992907801418	5	However, Quayle has four years to prove himself, and I think you're going to see stories in two years about how much he's learned, how much he's acted responsibly, how far he's come from the campaign of 1988.
0.240740740740741	5	Quayle admits the campaign was a learning process.
0.0984848484848485	5	After the controversies subsided, Quayle declared his independence from his Bush handlers, saying he would be his own man.
0.0802469135802469	5	He became more accessible to the media but continued to adhere to the schedule handed down from Washington and to deliver the party's scripted message.
0	5	Soon, he dropped off the front pages.
0	5	And although he occasionally spoke out in frustration at having little control over his schedule and at ceasing to make national news, he played the role of loyal No. 2 and even trumpeted his new anonymity.
0	5	We have arrived as being a traditional vice presidential nominee because we are either on the back pages or either not on the pages at all.
0	5	That's what we're supposed to be, he told reporters.
0.0555555555555556	5	That willingness to be a team player could serve him well in a Bush White House, Mahe feels, since Bush wants a private adviser, whose experience and opinion he respected has never had another agenda.
0.127450980392157	5	Dan Quayle owes his political life to one man and one man alone, Mahe says.
0.154761904761905	5	You're never going to see Dan Quayle telling tales out of school.
0.108333333333333	6	One year after his election, Dan Quayle has achieved all he ever wanted: He has become dull.
0	6	His coming-out party last Sunday was a true test of his new ability to not make news.
0	6	He went on the Press."
0	6	This was no small thing.
0	6	During his entire campaign for the vice presidency, Quayle refused all requests from such national interview shows.
0	6	He didn't appear on the Press" or Week With David Brinkley" or the Nation."
0	6	And he didn't do so because back then he was making too much news.
0	6	His every slip, his every gaffe, his every goof was news.
0	6	He was the stuff of nightly TV monologues.
0.108333333333333	6	lot of people feel Quayle is just too inexperienced for a do-nothing job," Jay Leno once said.
0.0481481481481481	6	That joke was not only funny, but it got to the heart of a strange phenomenon: Americans didn't give a damn about the vice presidency but some also felt that Quayle wasn't qualified for a job that had no qualifications.
0	6	So when Quayle got to Washington, he got there with one goal: Support the President and make himself a very small target.
0	6	Stay out of the headlines and give no reason for anyone to dump him in 1992.
0	6	had asked him on the show a number of times," Christie Basham, senior producer of the Press" told me, he always declined.
0	6	We renewed our request and then after saying he would not do the show, he changed his mind and said he would.
0	6	It was the 42nd anniversary of the show and we wanted someone above and beyond the usual guest."
0.206349206349206	6	And it says something about Dan Quayle's reputation that he would be considered and beyond" the usual guest.
0	6	Normally, a vice president would not be.
0	6	That's because vice presidents don't actually do anything.
0	6	They don't run departments or make policy.
0	6	They mostly wait for heads of state to expire.
0.12037037037037	6	As George Bush once joked about his duties as vice president: die; I fly."
0.154761904761905	6	But Quayle was considered a hot TV guest because he might screw up.
0	6	He might make a mistake or say something outrageous or disagree with the President.
0	6	None of this happened.
0	6	The show was uneventful.
0	6	Quayle answered all the questions put to him and he made little if any news.
0	6	Some major newspapers didn't even bother to do a story the next day.
0	6	It was everything Quayle had hoped for.
0	6	I asked David Beckwith, his spokesman, why Quayle had waited so long to go on a major interview show.
0	6	he wanted to concentrate on the more important part of the job," Beckwith said.
0	6	wanted to solidify his relationship with the President and learn the inner workings of the administration."
0	6	So why go on now?
0	6	seemed like a particularly opportune week," Beckwith said.
0.216666666666667	6	George Bush and Mikhail Gorbachev had announced a summit.
0	6	Central America was back in the news.
0.12037037037037	6	And, oh yeah, Bush had said Dan Quayle would be on the ticket in 1992.
0	6	Marlin called and just suggested we do the show," Beckwith said.
0.382352941176471	6	The selection of Dan Quayle had been Bush's first major decision of his presidential campaign.
0.509803921568627	6	He had input from a number of people, but Quayle was George Bush's choice.
0	6	Many thought it was a terrible choice, but there is nothing like a victory to give everything a rosy glow.
0.401234567901235	6	And Bush's announcement that Quayle would be his running mate again was Bush's way of saying: didn't screw up the first time.
0	6	I made a decision and it was the right decision and just to show you how right it was, I am making it again."
0.0902777777777778	6	And now was the time for Quayle to go on the Press" and show everybody just how right George Bush had been.
0	6	I asked Beckwith if Quayle had been pleased by how the show had gone.
0	6	was especially pleased with the seriousness of the questions," Beckwith said.
0	6	lot of the time, you never know what you're going to get into.
0	6	Sometimes the questions can be not particularly serious."
0.180555555555556	6	A typical example of a question often put to Dan Quayle is: does everyone say your wife is smarter than you?"
0	6	But Quayle got no questions like that last week.
0	6	I asked Christie Basham of the Press" if Quayle had asked in advance who the questioners would be.
0	6	Basham said, almost all the guests do."
0.0833333333333333	6	Quayle's questioners were David Broder of the Washington Post and Elizabeth Drew of the New Yorker, both of whom stuck to serious questions.
0	6	After the show, Fitzwater called Quayle to express his, and presumably the President's, pleasure at how Quayle had handled himself.
0	6	Quayle had said very little and he had said it very well.
0	6	very limitations of a vice president's role don't make him an ideal guest," Beckwith admitted.
0	6	by job description, a vice president is not permitted to make serious news."
0	6	And Quayle knows his future is in sticking to that.
0.0833333333333333	6	During the 1988 campaign, I interviewed Quayle and I came away with one overwhelming impression: Dan Quayle would run for President in 1996.
0	6	And he will do so, I believe, by being a vice president who keeps his head down, his nose clean and his life dull.
0.240740740740741	6	After all, it worked for George Bush.
0.131313131313131	7	PEOPLE in this picture-postcard town of Victorian houses and clean streets don't care what Jay Leno or the polls or the Democrats or disgruntled Republicans have been saying about Dan Quayle.
0.147727272727273	7	Despite the fact that President Bush's health problems have made the vice president a national preoccupation, to people here he's just Danny Quayle from Polk Street a really nice guy from a really nice family that runs the local newspaper.
0.0962962962962963	7	He is the most important person ever to come out of this town, and even as the world considers his fitness for the presidency, Huntington is celebrating his life in what is ambitiously being billed as the Premiere Dan Quayle Memorabilia Exhibit.
0	7	To those who say Quayle does not merit his own exhibition, Quayle devotees say with a mixture of defiance and dignity that he is, after all, the vice president of the United States.
0	7	preserving history," says David Schenkel, the exhibition coordinator.
0	7	century from now someone may want to do a dissertation on him."
0	7	If so, Huntington will be ready.
0.0734463276836158	7	Relatives, former classmates and longtime neighbors of Quayle have donated yearbooks, report cards, poems, letters, his Little League uniform, a coffee cup he drank from, a chair he once stood on during the 1988 presidential campaign and just about anything else he ever touched, wrote, signed or posed for.
0	7	The vice president's mother, Corinne, donated a lock of his baby hair.
0.166666666666667	7	The 1972 Indianapolis 500 queen produced a picture of Quayle, then an aide to Indiana Gov. Edgar Whitcomb, accompanying her to the race.
0.216666666666667	7	And a former housekeeper turned in a 20-year-old piece of carpeting she saved from one of Quayle's floors.
0.0492424242424242	7	The exhibition, which runs through May 20, was put together by the Dan Quayle Commemorative Foundation, a sort of fan-club-turned-archive devoted to documenting the life and times of the nation's 44th and, they say, least-understood vice president.
0	7	has taken such a bad rap," said Schenkel, a foundation board member.
0	7	people knew him, they'd see he's a regular person.
0.0833333333333333	7	If they had a chance to sit down with Dan as a neighbor, they would see the extremely good values in the man."
0.127450980392157	7	These are the faithful, who have long since stopped expecting press" on their man.
0	7	Instead they measure news reports on him by their relative negativity, describing the best coverage as upbeat" or decent."
0.309523809523809	7	They defend the relatively young age of Quayle, who turned 44 in February
0	7	his limited experience and his passion for golf
0	7	But they are careful not to stretch the superlatives.
0	7	The description comes up a lot.
0.0833333333333333	7	not the fool that the talk show hosts think he is," says Dottie Watson, president of the Republican Women of Huntington County.
0	7	a very nice person, a capable person.
0	7	Everybody I know says he can do it."
0.135416666666667	7	That is not to say some people don't have some friendly advice for Quayle.
0.0451388888888889	7	he would slow down, talk an octave lower and think about what he's saying, I don't think people would take him the way they do," said Jean Anne Drabenstot, the owner of Nick's Kitchen, Quayle's favorite restaurant.
0	7	Hayden Schenkel, chairman of the Huntington County Democratic Party and a distant cousin of David Schenkel, says, people would shudder and shiver if he accidentally became president of the United States.
0	7	Most of the Democrats and even some of the Republicans would say they're tickled to death to have him as vice president, and they're 100 percent behind him.

0	1	People began recognizing him and coming up and greeting him, said store manager Paul Sively.
0	1	He shook their hands and talked to everyone he could.
0	1	The registers were out for about 45 minutes, and I don't think we had one customer complain.
0.172043010752688	1	Walton, known for his down-home style, made a surprise visit to the store that later Tuesday staged a concert by country singer Jana Jea in its parking lot.

0.296296296296296	2	He's ranked as the richest man in the nation by a leading business magazine, but to folks in Bentonville, a town of about 8,700 people, Sam Walton is just another neighbor.
0	2	He's just a part of the community, said Curt Loyd, executive director of the Bentonville Chamber of Commerce.
0	2	He's a neat person.
0	2	He calls Bentonville home, and that is special to us.
0.304761904761905	2	Walton, who prefers bird-hunting, tennis and opening new Wal-Mart stores to trumpeting his personal financial holdings, is again shunning publicity about his third consecutive ranking among the world's top billionaires.
0	2	According to Forbes magazine's July 24 edition, the Walton family's estimated worth is $8.7 billion, up from its 1988 estimate of $6.5 billion.
0	2	He is unavailable, said Wal-Mart spokesman Don Shinkle of the silver-haired founder of the nation's third-largest retail chain, based in Bentonville, about 150 miles northwest of Little Rock.
0	2	Shinkle said he received about 10 calls from reporters Monday morning, when the Forbes list appeared in newspapers.
0	2	Shinkle said news coverage about Walton usually sets off a press frenzy for comments from him.
0	2	But the 71-year-old businessman declined to comment.
0.222222222222222	2	He feels any attention to Sam Walton is to the individual and he prefers attention to Sam Walton the company, Shinkle said.
0	2	He very seldom schedules interviews about his feelings.
0	2	It just puts him in a position he doesn't want to be.
0	2	But Walton occasionally offers peeks that reveal personal modesty.
0	2	Just after the 1987 stock market crash, in which Walton's family-owned chunk of Wal-Mart stock lost millions in value, he quipped in response to questions at a news conference on another topic that it was only paper.
0	2	Walton then changed the subject.
0.5	2	Walton was first listed by Forbes as the nation's richest man in October 1985.
0.380952380952381	2	Three years ago, Forbes also began listing the world's wealthiest people.
0.222222222222222	2	Walton made that listing as the richest American every year since.
0	2	This year he ranks third, behind two Japanese businessmen.
0	2	Shinkle said Walton stays busy visiting many of the more than 1,400 stores operated by the company he started as a single five-and-dime at Rogers more than two decades ago.
0	2	He is out of the office up to four days a week, the spokesman said.
0	2	He spends most of his time talking to associates and customers, Shinkle said, and he always comes back with many ideas from them.
0.266666666666667	2	Wal-Mart calls its sales help associates instead of employees.
0	2	When Walton first made the Forbes list of richest Americans, recalled Little Rock investment banker Warren Simpson, calls came in from all over about the billionaire from the Ozarks.
0	2	They wanted to know about the stock and the company, said Simpson, who works for Stephens Inc. You'd think that he'd be living in New York or LA, not Bentonville, Arkansas.
0	2	But now people just accept it.
0	2	When it comes out now, it's just, he's still there,' Simpson said.
0.0860215053763441	3	Forty years after Sam Walton first hung out his shingle, Walton's 5&amp;10 will reopen to show how a little rural storekeeper built a discount retail empire.
0	3	Wal-Mart Stores Inc.'s Visitors Center opens Wednesday in the same building on the downtown square where Walton first opened for business on May 9, 1950.
0	3	The center chronicles the rise of the nation's fastest-growing discount chain, using displays and audio-video presentations.
0.140350877192982	3	It concentrates on how the free enterprise system works and how Wal-Mart thrived when similar companies didn't.
0	3	The window displays date back to the store's opening, with Simplicity patterns and Johnson's Glo-Coat, a box of Dreft and some Ivory Snow.
0	3	Inside, an electronic map details the company's 1,500-plus store chain today.
0.0683760683760684	3	Also on display at the center is the hula skirt that Sam Walton donned for his dance on Wall Street, which he performed after challenging the company to reach a record 8 percent pre-tax profit in 1984.
0	3	The goal was accomplished and he danced.
0.111111111111111	3	The old and the modern together reflect the corporate culture of the nation's biggest discount retailer behind K mart Corp. of Detroit.

0.507936507936508	3	Also on display is a photograph of young Sam Walton, a fat-faced baby born in Oklahoma in the 1920s.
0	3	Typical of the Wal-Mart outlook, Dust Bowl Oklahoma is termed a place to grow and to dream in a video on the Walton family.
0.242424242424242	3	After a stint with J.C. Penney Co. and the Army, he opened a Ben Franklin store in Newport in 1945.
0	3	He lost the lease on that one, and relocated to Bentonville.
0	3	That's where the story took off.
0.106666666666667	3	Sam Walton convinced Bob Bogle, then a public health officer, to take over management of his Bentonville Ben Franklin store in 1955.
0.0683760683760684	3	Walton said he wanted to put in about a dozen stores and needed someone to tend the shop in Bentonville while he and his brother built a chain of Ben Franklins, Bogle said in a recent interview.
0	3	That's when Bogle found himself in Walton's learn as you go training program.
0	3	I got home at 10 o'clock that night after scrubbing and waxing the floor with Sam, Bogle said.
0	3	Inauspicious first impressions are part of the story.
0.216216216216216	3	In one video, David Glass, who succeeded Sam Walton as chief executive of Wal-Mart in 1988, recalled his impressions after attending the opening of the second Wal-Mart Discount City at Harrison in 1964.
0	3	The first store, at Rogers, opened two years earlier.
0	3	I thought to myself this is absolutely the worst discount store, or retail store, I have ever seen, said Glass, who was president of a drugstore chain at the time.
0	3	And Wal-Mart Vice Chairman Donald Soderquist recalls that when Walton took his idea of putting discount stores in rural areas to Ben Franklin headquarters in Chicago, officials there just really didn't see a future in it.
0.0476190476190476	3	Don Shinkle, Wal-Mart's director of corporate and public affairs, attributed Wal-Mart's success to its associates the term for employees first coined in 1972 to stress that all Wal-Mart employees are partners in the company and to Sam Walton's leadership and knack for hiring the right person at the right time.
0	3	At the start of 1990, Wal-Mart owned 1,402 stores, employed 272,000 and listed sales of $25.8 billion.
0	3	Sam's Wholesale Club closed out the year with 123 units and Wal-Mart announced plans to enter the California market.
0	4	SAM WALTON was arguably the most important retailer of his generation.
0.0701754385964912	4	The son of an Oklahoma real-estate broker, he opened the first general store in what was to become the Wal-Mart chain in Bentonville, in the backwaters of Arkansas, in 1950, writes Martin Dickson.
0.549019607843137	4	By 1991 the chain's sales had risen to nearly Dollars 44bn, making it the world's largest retailer in terms of revenues, and the Walton family probably America's richest.
0	4	Wal-Mart now operates in 43 US states, selling goods ranging from detergents to golf clubs.
0.421052631578947	4	The chain's success stemmed both from Mr Walton's personality and willingness to challenge accepted retailing orthodoxy.
0.126984126984127	4	He was a frugal, modest man who worked extremely long hours from a spartan room in his Bentonville headquarters but delighted in getting out of the office to tour stores and meet customers and staff, whom he insisted on calling
0	4	He would deliver pep-talks to employees extolling the virtues of thrift and customer satisfaction, long before these became fashionable management buzz-words.
0	4	Employee satisfaction an idea which is only now gaining wider acceptance in US service industries was also a vital ingredient in the Walton philosophy.
0	4	He buoyed staff morale with cheer-leading sessions, bonus payments for good performance and profit-sharing plans which allowed some employees of very modest means to retire relatively wealthy.
0	4	Eight years ago, when Wal-Mart's profits were better than expected, he kept a promise to staff by dressing in a grass-skirt to dance the hula on Wall Street.
0.0808080808080808	4	Also essential to Wal-Mart's growth was its pioneering of high volume, cut-price retailing throughout the year, rather than the periodic sales which rivals relied on to generate customer loyalty.

0	4	Mr Walton also disproved the conventional wisdom that large discount stores could not operate successfully in the small, rural towns of the US south.
0.0579710144927536	4	It was precisely such locations which became the bedrock of the business, though in the process Wal-Mart put out of business hundreds of small main street stores, prompting bitter resistance in some towns which Mr Walton tended to blunt with generous charitable donations.

0	5	269 pages Being an American folk hero is a tricky assignment, as Ross Perot found out.
0	5	The problem is that the great American public likes its boot-strap entrepreneurs to be very rich and very upright.
0.140350877192982	5	In a country where business practices are not overly genteel, this is a tough combination to achieve.
0	5	A vast media circus, meanwhile, is quick to expose any flaws.
0.41025641025641	5	Sam Walton, founder of the Wal-Mart chain of discount supermarkets who died of cancer in April, negotiated these pitfalls much better than most.
0.148148148148148	5	When, in 1985, Forbes magazine declared him America's richest entrepreneur, the paparazzi descended on the obscure corner of Arkansas, mainly occupied by chicken farmers, where Walton made his home.
0	5	What they found was a happily married, much-liked billionaire who enjoyed quail hunting, breakfasted at the local Holiday Inn, and drove a battered pick-up truck, minus two hub-caps.
0	5	Folksy was an understatement.
0.0833333333333333	5	Since then, some aspects of Wal-Mart's business its anti-union policies, the impact of its Dollars 40bn annual sales on hundreds of Mom-and-Pop shops been subject to critical scrutiny.
0	5	So, to an extent, have the less wholesome adventures of the four Walton children.
0	5	But no one has ever been able to make Sam himself look bad.
0	5	The worst that has been said is that he was rather dull.
0	5	Walton is not about to dash anyone's illusions.
0.253968253968254	5	Readers will either find his autobiography lashed with ol common-sense and a lot of harmless, if charming, anecdotes.
0	5	Or they will find it dreary and downbeat.
0	5	Walton makes no excuses: realise this may sound boring to most you,' he writes at one stage, one of my best items ever was a mattress pad called a Bedmate
0	5	A few snippets are more revealing about the character.
0	5	There cannot be many billionaires who admit that they learned handwriting too well' and have the guts to include a photograph which demonstrates the point.
0.355555555555556	5	Meanwhile, the competitive energy which Sam Walton applied to his business is inescapable.
0	5	In one of many contributions from friends and family, Don Soderquist, Wal-Mart's chief operating officer, tells of finding Sam one Saturday morning on his hand and knees at the local Kmart store, analysing his rival's stock.
0	5	And his wife, in a casual aside, notes that when the couple was on holiday in Italy their luggage vanished while her husband was off on a similar scouting mission.
0	5	But it is David Glass, Wal-Mart's current chief executive, who perhaps captures the entrepreneurial Walton spirit best.
0	5	Explaining the annual contest in which Wal-Mart executives choose one producing item' to promote, he recalls the time Sam selected minnow buckets for carrying bait.
0	5	Glass was more happily teamed with apple juice.
0	5	I would go down to the stores, and get them to take that minnow bucket put ice in it, ice down the juice and give away samples out of his minnow bucket.
0	5	I particularly did it in stores I knew was going to visit.
0	5	It drove him crazy, and he got off that minnow bucket pretty quick But the reader can't help feeling that the cosy yarns tell only half the truth.
0.0808080808080808	5	Sam Walton was a salesman to the core, and seems to have packaged himself with all the skill that he once applied to selling a gooey southern sweet called Moon Pies.
0.166666666666667	5	For the most part, this makes for an engaging, if one-dimensional, portrait.
0	5	Occasionally, it just grates.
0	5	I had bought a bank in Bentonville, for about about Dollars 300,000,' Walton remarks, for example, a little old bank with only about Dollars 3.5m in deposits.
0	5	But it helped me learn a lot about financing things.'
0	5	Oh, come on Sam, is that the whole story?
0	5	The real truth, one suspects, comes right at the end of the book when Walton admits that I hadn't gotten sick, I doubt I would have written this book'.
0	5	Given the pleadings of publishers Doubleday paid about Dollars 4m for the manuscript and a rather natural desire to have a final say, he can hardly be blamed for agreeing to write it.
0	5	But these are unlikely to be circumstances which make for the most critical self-analysis.
0.126984126984127	5	At the end of the day, Sam Walton's heritage is in the shopping malls, not the bookstores.
0.0512820512820513	6	A HISTORY OF SAM WALTON'S RETAIL PHENOMENON' by Sandra S. Vance and Roy V. Scott Twayne Publishers, New York, Dollars 14.95 240 pages Many people might be said to be the personification of the American Dream; few are better qualified for that title than Sam Walton.
0.213333333333333	6	Walton is a character it would be difficult to invent, an all-American boy who became one of the world's most successful businessmen.
0.848484848484849	6	The church-going son of a farmer born in 1918 near Kingfisher, Oklahoma, he founded a store chain which made him America's richest man, and which, shortly before his death in 1992, became the world's biggest retailer.
0.133333333333333	6	His company, Wal-Mart, made sales of Dollars 55bn last year, and after Walton's death Fortune magazine reported that his wife and four children held between them the second-largest fortune in the world Dollars 23.5bn.
0	6	What is most startling about Wal-Mart is the speed of its growth.
0.177777777777778	6	Although Walton built up a small chain of Ben Franklin variety store franchises from 1945, it was not until 1962 that he opened his first Wal-Mart discount store.
0.133333333333333	6	At the time of its incorporation in 1971, Wal-Mart had only 38 outlets with sales of Dollars 44m not enough to earn a place in trade journal Discount Merchandiser's list of the 71 biggest US discount retailers.
0.115942028985507	6	Ten years later, with 330 stores and Dollars 1.6bn sales, it was only the 33rd-biggest retailer in the US.
0	6	Its turnover was only 9 per cent of that of Sears Roebuck, the biggest, and 11 per cent of K mart, the second-biggest.
0	6	Within another 10 years, Wal-Mart had overtaken them both.
0.242424242424242	6	Apart from Walton's autobiography completed shortly before his death, however, published material about the company is curiously scarce.
0.0740740740740741	6	This book attempts to fill the gap, to provide a account' of the rise of Wal-Mart, setting it in the wider context of US retailing, and explaining how it was achieved.
0.784313725490196	6	One strength the authors identify is Wal-Mart's ability to copy and adapt from other retailers.
1	6	Sam Walton did not invent discount retailing.
0	6	Rather, he realised the threat discounting posed to his own variety store business and studied in depth many of the US's leading discounters of the early 1960s, including Ann and Hope, E J Korvette, Spartan's, Fed-Mart, and K mart.
0.062015503875969	6	Walton learned from them all, but was unique in taking his discount stores into small towns of a few thousand people, where shoppers used to travelling long distances were delighted to have a cut-price store nearby selling everything they needed.
0	6	Another strength is Wal-Mart's openness to technology.
0.216216216216216	6	As early as the 1950s, Walton realised he was wasting too much time travelling and bought a small aircraft to pilot between stores himself something he continued to do to the end of his life.
0	6	Sometimes, Walton was more reluctant to invest in technology, and had to be persuaded by colleagues to introduce computers, and scanning at check-outs long before most retailers had recognised their importance and to invest Dollars 20m in an internal satellite communications system.
0.166666666666667	6	This technology helped Wal-Mart build one of the most efficient distribution systems of any retailer.
0.106666666666667	6	But perhaps the most fundamental reason for its success, the book suggests, has been Wal-Mart's streamlined and highly responsive management structure.
0	6	Regional vice-presidents based at group headquarters in Bentonville, Arkansas, rather than in costly regional offices, are despatched every Monday by aircraft to their regions, spend the week visiting stores, working with staff and managers, and return for a day-long merchandising meeting every Friday.
0	6	They discuss results, problems and suggestions from the week at a 7.30am meeting on Saturdays and immediately afterwards call district managers to relate the results.
0	6	District managers hold a conference call with their store managers, and before the day is out, the contents of the meeting have been communicated to all store department heads.
0	6	The system means employees can make suggestions to vice-presidents one week and, if the idea is accepted by the Saturday meeting, see its implementation begin the following week.
0.444444444444444	6	Even the world's most successful retailer makes mistakes, however.
0	6	One was Walton's decision to stand down from the chairman and chief executive's role in 1974 in favour of Ronald Mayer, only to return to both roles in 1976 after finding he was incapable of letting go of the reins.
0.156862745098039	6	Another was Wal-Mart's short-lived Hypermart format, which proved too big even for gigantist America.
0	6	Then there was Walton's rash promise to do a dance' on Wall Street if Wal-Mart achieved an 8 per cent pre-tax profit margin in 1984.
0	6	It did, and he did.
0.333333333333333	6	The book also covers well the debate over whether Wal-Mart's impact on the economies of small US towns was positive or negative.
0.307692307692308	6	If there are criticisms, these are that this account' never quite captures the sheer excitement of working in the world's fastest-growing retailer.
0.0888888888888889	6	Moreover, it makes little attempt to predict whether Wal-Mart can continue its growth, and conquer the rest of the world in the way it conquered the US.
0	6	But this is a well-researched and accessible account of one man's success in building his own American dream.

In August 1992 Hurricane Andrew hit the Bahamas , southern Florida , and Louisiana leaving 19 dead and extensive property damage . In Florida a quarter of a million were left homeless . The cost to insurers , concentrated in U.S. companies , was estimated as high as $ 20 billion and much of the damaged property was not insured . Federal authorities promised emergency aid after Florida officials complained of delays in supplying food and water . The cost of rebuilding Florida and caring for those displaced by the storm was estimated at $ 20 - $ 30 billion . Fortunately the storm did not hit low-lying New Orleans or oil facilities along the gulf coast . 
Damage from Hurricane Andrew is estimated at $ 20 billion , with $ 8 billion covered by insurance . American insurers will take the brunt of the claims , but General Accident , the leading British insurer , expects claims to rise as high as $ 40 million . Andrew tore through southern Florida , leaving 15 dead , power outages , and polluted water in his wake . Homestead and the nearby air force base were flattened . In Dade County , 250,000 people are homeless . Andrew next smashed into Louisiana , killing two . It missed the important oil refineries , but damaged crops and the oyster and alligator businesses . The dollar sustained a similar assault . 
0.528455284552846	0	WHILE Hurricane Andrew was wreaking havoc across large parts of southern Florida and Louisiana this week, a grade two dollar crisis was blowing itself out at the end of a tumultuous few days for US and world financial markets.
0.309523809523809	0	On Wall Street, most of the damage from the currency storm was inflicted a week ago Friday and on the following Monday, when bond yields jumped sharply and the Dow Jones industrial average plunged by more than 75 points.
0	0	The flimsy walls erected hastily by the Federal Reserve and other big central banks to protect the vulnerable dollar from a tidal wave of selling on foreign exchange markets failed to hold; and as the sellers poured through the breached barricades, the currency dropped to DM1.40.
0	0	This was its lowest-ever point against the D-mark.
0	0	The conditions necessary for a dollar crisis had been building up in currency markets for some time.
0	0	Interest rate differentials between US and Germany widened over the summer as the Fed eased, and the Bundesbank tightened, their respective monetary policies.
0.166666666666667	0	The failure of the US economy to climb out of recession with any vigour was also making overseas investors increasingly unhappy about holding the dollar.
0	0	So, too, was the political hole President Bush had dug for himself in a re-election battle that only a year ago was supposed to be a shoo-in for the incumbent.
0.111111111111111	0	Moreover, the fact that almost every central bank worth its salt was in the markets trying to prop up the dollar served only to convince foreign exchange dealers that the currency was heading in one direction down.
0.135416666666667	0	While there were plenty of reasons for the dealers to sell the dollar, the logic for such a strongly negative reaction from bond and stock markets was less obviously compelling.
0	0	There are two standard explanations why a weak dollar prompts bond prices to fall.
0	0	The first is that it raises import prices and, as a result, adds to inflationary pressures.
0	0	The second is that it makes it hard for the Fed to engineer another cut in interest rates to stimulate the flagging recovery, and raises the possibility that rates may actually have to go up to protect the currency.
0	0	The first explanation is not particularly convincing imports account for not much more than 10 per cent of US gross domestic product, so higher import prices do not greatly effect the overall price level, which is now around 3 per cent and heading lower.
0	0	The second explanation carries more weight.
0.0902777777777778	0	Although there is not much chance, given the present economic and political climate, that the Fed will raise rates to help the dollar, there is little doubt that the currency's weakness makes it extremely difficult for the Fed to ease monetary policy again.
0	0	The fear that the Fed may be done with interest rate cuts for the present economic cycle was also behind the selling in equity markets.
0	0	But investors in stocks were equally, if not more, troubled by the rise in bond yields.
0	0	Just over a week ago, the yield on the benchmark 30-year bond, which has remained stubbornly high all year despite the poor state of the economy, looked as if it might drop below 7.3 per cent.
0.123809523809524	0	The dollar put paid to those hopes and, by the middle of this week, it was approaching 7.45 per cent, putting an upward pressure on the all-important mortgage rate for home-buyers.
0.254901960784314	0	The dollar was not the only story in financial markets this week, and the devastating effect of Hurricane Andrew produced a typically hard-eyed, although nonetheless logical, reaction from Wall Street.
0.320987654320988	0	The stocks of those insurance companies with the greatest exposure in southern Florida, the area hit worst by the hurricane, all took a tumble.
0	0	But the relatively modest losses in Geico, Travelers and Progressive suggested that the market believed the insurers were reserved or reinsured adequately enough to cover hurricane-related claims.
0	0	The flip side of the hurricane's coin was a strong showing from the stocks of home construction companies expected to benefit from demand for rebuilding damaged or destroyed homes.
0.565217391304348	0	Since there are an estimated 250,000 people left homeless by the storm, there is a lot of work to be done.
0	0	The biggest gains among construction stocks this week were posted by Lennar, Oakwood Homes, Engle Homes and Fleetwood, the largest maker of pre-manufactured homes in the US.
0.555555555555555	1	SQUADS of workers fanned out across storm-battered Louisiana yesterday to begin a massive rebuilding effort after Hurricane Andrew had flattened whole districts, killing two people and injuring dozens more, agencies report from Florida and New Orleans.
0.541666666666667	1	However, local officials in Florida, hit earlier in the week by the hurricane, were critical of what they called a delay in supplying food, drinking water and other supplies for thousands of people in need.
0.131313131313131	1	Federal emergency officials acknowledged distribution problems, Transportation Secretary Andrew Card yesterday promised improvements within 24 hours and President George Bush last night ordered troops to Florida, without specifying a number.
0.833333333333333	1	The government estimated it would cost Dollars 20bn-Dollars 30bn to tidy and rebuild in Florida, and to care for residents displaced by the storm.
0	1	Louisiana state officials said they had no overall count of storm-related injuries but initial estimates reckoned fewer than 100.
0	1	The Federal Emergency Management Agency said it was setting aside Dollars 77m to help Louisiana recover.
0.393939393939394	1	Most of the storm's fury was spent against sparsely populated farming communities and swampland in the state, sparing it the widespread destruction caused in Florida, where 15 people died.
0.641975308641975	1	Official estimates in Miami reported that the hurricane had wiped out the homes of one Dade County resident in eight a quarter of a million people.
0	1	Andrew had become little more than a strong rainstorm early yesterday, moving across Mississippi state and heading for the north-eastern US.
0.541666666666667	1	Several of Louisiana's main industries were affected, including those of oysters and alligators.
0	1	Wildlife and fisheries secretary Joe Herring estimated a 50 per cent decline in the alligator industry.
0	1	The cotton and sugar-cane crops were threatened, the state agriculture department said.
0.412698412698413	1	Most Louisiana oil refineries, however, were barely affected and deliveries of crude oil were expected to resume yesterday.
1	2	GENERAL ACCIDENT, the leading British insurer, said yesterday that insurance claims arising from Hurricane Andrew could it as much as Dollars 40m.'
0.433333333333333	2	Lord Airlie, the chairman who was addressing an extraordinary shareholders' meeting, said: the basis of emerging information, General Accident advise that the losses to their US operations arising from Hurricane Andrew, which struck Florida and Louisiana, might in total reach the level at which external catastrophe reinsurance covers would become exposed'.
0	2	What this means is that GA is able to pass on its losses to external reinsurers once a certain claims threshold has been breached.
0.309523809523809	2	It believes this threshold may be breached in respect of Hurricane Andrew claims.
0	2	However, if this happens, it would suffer a post-tax loss of Dollars 40m
0	2	Mr Nelson Robertson, GA's chief general manager, explained later that the company has a 1/2 per cent share of the Florida market.
0	2	It has a branch in Orlando.
0	2	The company's loss adjusters are in the area trying to estimate the losses.
0	2	Their guess is that losses to be faced by all insurers may total more than Dollars 8bn.
0.693333333333333	2	Not all damaged property in the area is insured and there have been estimates that the storm caused more than Dollars 20bn of damage.
0	2	However, other insurers have estimated that losses could be as low as Dollars 1bn in total.
0	2	Mr Robertson said: one knows at this time what the exact loss is'.
0.433333333333333	3	HURRICANE Andrew, claimed to be the costliest natural disaster in US history, yesterday smashed its way through the state of Louisiana, inflicting severe damage on rural communities but narrowly missing the low-lying city of New Orleans.
0.211382113821138	3	The storm, which brought havoc to southern Florida on Monday and then headed north-west across the Gulf of Mexico, had made landfall late on Tuesday night some 60 miles south-west of the city in the agricultural Cajun country.
0.26530612244898	3	Although the damage from the hurricane's landfall in Florida on Monday was much greater than initially esti mated, insurers' losses there are likely to total less than Dollars 1bn, well below earlier expectations, a senior member of Lloyd's insurance market said yesterday.
0.131313131313131	3	In Louisiana, the hurricane landed with wind speeds of about 120 miles per hour and caused severe damage in small coastal centres such as Morgan City, Franklin and New Iberia.
0.361111111111111	3	Associated tornadoes devastated Laplace, 20 miles west of New Orleans.
0	3	Then, however, Andrew lost force as it moved north over land.
0	3	By yesterday afternoon, it had been down-graded to tropical storm, in that its sustained windspeeds were below 75 mph.
0.382352941176471	3	Initial reports said at least one person had died, 75 been injured and thousands made homeless along the Louisiana coast, after 14 confirmed deaths in Florida and three in the Bahamas.
0.180555555555556	3	The storm caused little damage to Louisiana's important oil-refining industry, although some plants had to halt production when electricity was cut.
0.541666666666667	3	The Lloyd's member, in close contact with leading insurers in Florida, said that damage to insured property was remarkably small.
0	3	More than Dollars 15bn of damage may have been caused in all, but was mostly to uninsured property, he said.
0	3	In north Miami, damage is minimal.
0	3	Worst affected is one hotel, whose basement was flooded.
0	3	Most of the destruction occurred in a 10-mile band across Homestead, 25 miles to the south of Miami, where a typical house sells for Dollars 100,000 to Dollars 150,000.
0.216666666666667	3	US insurers will face a bill in respect of such properties, but Lloyd's exposure there is minimal.
0	3	Many destroyed power lines are thought to be uninsured, as are trees and shrubs uprooted across a wide area.
0	3	Only one big hotel in that area has been badly damaged, a Holiday Inn.
0.333333333333333	3	Across Florida, some 2m people remained without electric ity yesterday and health officials were warning the public to boil or chemically treat all water.
0	3	Hurricane Hugo, which devastated much of South Carolina in 1989, cost the insurance industry some Dollars 4.2bn.
0	3	Further uninsured losses may have raised the total to Dollars 6bn-Dollars 10bn.
0.351351351351351	4	DAMAGE CAUSED by Hurricane Andrew could rise to Dollars 20bn, it was estimated yesterday, as one of the costliest US storms this century threatened a further devastating landfall near the city of New Orleans.
0.206349206349206	4	Government officials in Louisiana, Mississippi and Texas yesterday advised or ordered more than 2m people to evacuate coastal areas.
0.403100775193798	4	The hurricane tore through southern Florida early on Monday morning, causing billions of dollars of property damage and at least 12 deaths, and yesterday was moving north-west across the Gulf of Mexico with winds of about 140 miles an hour.
0.619047619047619	4	At least three people died on Sunday when Hurricane Andrew crossed the Bahamas.
0.842592592592593	4	Ms Kate Hale, director of emergency services in Florida's Dade County, which bore the brunt of the storm, estimated that Andrew had already caused Dollars 15bn to Dollars 20bn of damage.
0.254901960784314	4	However, insurance industry analysts cautioned that it was too early to assess the costs accurately.
0	4	The US industry's Property Claims Service, the official compiler of disaster losses, had yet to compile a preliminary tally of the Florida bill.
0	4	A hurricane warning was in effect yesterday along 470 miles of Gulf coast from Pascagoula, Mississippi, to Galvestone, Texas.
0.320987654320988	4	Several forecasting agencies suggested the likeliest landfall was in central Louisiana, to the west of New Orleans, possibly late last night or this morning.
0.114035087719298	4	New Orleans, with a population of 1.6m, is particularly vulnerable because the city lies below sea level, has the Mississippi River running through its centre and a large lake immediately to the north.
0.188405797101449	4	Much of America's oil refining industry is concentrated along coastal Texas and Louisiana and several refineries were yesterday partially shut down.
0	4	These included British Petroleum's Belle Chasse plant in Louisiana.
0.456140350877193	4	In Florida, Andrew caused greatest havoc in a largely suburban swathe some 10-15 miles south of Miami.
0.565217391304348	4	The town of Homestead, near the centre of the storm, was largely flattened, including a local air force base.
0.433333333333333	4	Miami's city centre escaped with relatively light damage.
0	4	More than 24 hours after the hurricane, some 825,000 households and businesses were still without power.
0.234234234234234	4	The brunt of insurance claims from the Florida storm will fall on the US industry, and companies with a heavy local exposure include the State Farm Group and the Allstate Insurance unit of Sears Roebuck.
0.456140350877193	4	These are also the leading property/casualty and home insurance groups in Louisiana, together with American International Group.
0	4	A spokesman for State Farm Insurance said he believed the company had roughly 20 per cent of the Florida market.
0	4	The mutually-owned company has no reinsurance.
0	4	Its size has made obtaining reinsurance cover difficult and its reserves, at about Dollars 24bn, have made it unnecessary.
0	4	According to Balcombe Group, a UK-based claims adjustment firm, other insurers with large exposure in the hurricane-hit area are Hartford Insurance, Aetna and Travellers.
0	4	Travellers said it had flown 50 claims adjusters in to Florida late on Monday and was assessing losses.
0	4	About 12 per cent of Travellers' home insurance premium income came from Florida last year, and 4.6 per cent of its commercial insurance premiums.
0	4	The last serious US hurricane, Hugo, which struck South Carolina in 1989, cost the industry Dollars 4.2bn from insured losses, though estimates of the total damage caused ranged between Dollars 6bn and Dollars 10bn.
0.555555555555555	5	US CITIES along the Gulf of Mexico from Alabama to eastern Texas were on storm watch last night as Hurricane Andrew headed west after sweeping across southern Florida, causing at least eight deaths and severe property damage.
0.333333333333333	5	The hurricane was one of the fiercest in the US in decades and the first to hit Miami directly in a quarter of a century.
0.433333333333333	5	In the Bahamas, government spokesman Mr Jimmy Curry said four deaths had been reported on outlying eastern islands.
0	5	Mr Justin Balcombe, of UK-based insurance adjuster Balcombe Group, said total losses could exceed Dollars 15bn if business interruption claims were taken into account.
0	5	That compares with the Dollars 4bn-Dollars 6n of insurance industry losses caused by the last big US hurricane, Hugo, which hit South Carolina in 1989.
0.684210526315789	5	The brunt of the losses are likely to be concentrated among US insurers, industry analysts said yesterday.
0	5	Mr George Lloyd-Roberts, chairman of Lloyd's Underwriters' Non-Marine Association, said that, unless damage claims exceeded Pounds 3bn, the Lloyd's insurance market would feel little impact.
0	5	Because the reinsurance of reinsurance risk known as the retrocession market has shrunk considerably in recent years, US insurers have placed far fewer of their risks through Lloyd's.
0	5	Mr Roger Hill, insurance analyst at Warburg Securities, said he estimated that mainline UK insurers faced no more than Pounds 75m in damage claims so far.
0	5	the moment we are relaxed about it,' he said.
0	5	The real question, he added, is the level of reinsurance available to the UK underwriters.
0	5	Royal Insurance estimated the company's losses at no more than Pounds 20m.
0.234234234234234	5	Among other UK insurers, Mr Hill estimated that General Accident may face losses of up to Pounds 30m, while Guardian Royal Exchange faced Pounds 5m and Sun Alliance and Commercial Union Pounds 10m each.
0.317073170731707	5	However, Hurricane Andrew gathered fresh strength as it moved across the Gulf of Mexico and there was concern last night that it might head towards New Orleans, which is especially low lying and could suffer severe flood damage.
0.166666666666667	5	Scientists said the storm could make landfall anywhere between the Alabama port of Mobile and the Louisiana-Texas border, probably tomorrow night or early Thursday.
0	5	It could threaten the large concentration of offshore oil production facilities in the Gulf of Mexico.
0	5	Shell Oil was evacuating most of the 900 workers on its offshore platforms as a precaution.
0	5	A substantial part of America's oil refining industry is concentrated on the Gulf coast, in Louisiana and Texas, and officials there were reviewing emergency plans to curtail or shut down plant operations.
0.180555555555556	5	Andrew, the first Caribbean hurricane of the season, hit the eastern coast of Florida early yesterday, gusting up to 165mph.
0	5	It ripped roofs off houses, smashed cars and trucks, snapped power lines and uprooted trees before heading out over the Gulf.
0.541666666666667	5	A million people had been ordered to flee their homes in southern Florida as the hurricane moved in from the Bahamas on Sunday.
0	5	The Florida Power and Light company said that about 1.2m of its customers, or 32 per cent, were without power.
0	5	Some of the strongest winds were in the affluent suburb of Coral Gables, just south of Miami, where the National Hurricane Center is located.
0	5	Its radar and satellite antennae were blown away.
0	5	President Bush authorised federal disaster assistance for the affected areas and made plans for an inspection tour of the state.

0.117647058823529	2	The remarks, a copy of which were obtained by The Associated Press, indicates that a united Germany would be free to join the Western NATO alliance after a five-year transitional period.
0.2	2	But in exchange, Western and Soviet troops would pull out of the country and Germany's own military strength would be sharply reduced, according to the proposal.
0.137931034482759	2	Shevardnadze made the proposal as he met with U.S. Secretary of State James A. Baker III and their counterparts from Britain, France and the two German states.
0.0909090909090909	2	I am underwhelmed, Baker said when asked about the Soviet proposal while posing for pictures with the other foreign ministers.
0	2	A U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said U.S. officials objected to the five-year time limit before Germany could join NATO.
0	2	The official said the other Western ministers expressed the same reservations.
0	2	The United States wants a united Germany to be a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Soviet Union has been staunchly opposed.
0.3	2	West Germany now is a mainstay of NATO and East Germany is a member of the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact.
0	2	Shevardnadze said the Soviet proposal seeks to limit the strength of the German armed forces and to revamp their structure to make sure that they are rendered incapable for offensive operations.
0	2	It said those reductions could be undertaken over a three-year period.
0	2	Germany also would be prevented from producing or deploying chemmical or nuclear weapons.
0.0606060606060606	2	It also said that within six months of unification, all Western troops should leave West Berlin, which remains technically under military occupation by the United States, France and Britian.
0.05	2	The four nations would reduce their military forces in the country during a three-year period following unification first by 50 percent, then bring them down to a level of token contingents, or completely withdraw them from Germany.
0.193548387096774	2	There are about 380,000 Soviet troops in East Germany, while a quarter-million U.S. troops are stationed in West Germany along with tens of thousands of British and French soldiers.
0.125	2	Previously, the Soviets had said their troops would stay in what is now East Germany for several years, but had left unclear the exact plans for pulling them out.
0.324324324324324	2	Shevardnadze, speaking earlier at a ceremony for the removal of the Western Allies' Checkpoint Charlie, said he wanted the Big Four Powers' troops out of greater Berlin within six months after unification.
0.0625	2	The proposal, as translated into English by the Soviets and distributed to the news media, apparently would also include the Kremlin's soldiers stationed just outside the city proper.
0	2	The United States, France and Great Britain have an estimated 12,000 troops in West Berlin.
0	2	An official reached by telephone in the office of the military attache at the Soviet embassy in East Berlin said there were no Soviet troops stationed in the city proper.
0	3	Maik Polster was a stern-faced member of the East German secret police.
0	3	Patrick Gainey took pictures for the U.S. Army.
0	3	Andreas Bratke was an East German who wanted to be a West German.
0	3	Illa Wobig saw eight people just like him die on her street.
0.244897959183673	3	What they all had in common was a little white shack on the west side of the Berlin Wall, a guardhouse with a funny name that stood as a chilling symbol of the tensions that divided a street, a city, a nation, the world.
0.666666666666667	3	Checkpoint Charlie, the famed Allied border crossing on the west side of the Berlin Wall, was lifted into the sky by a giant crane Friday, placed gently onto a flatbed truck and consigned to history.
0.32258064516129	3	It was emptied, locked and taken away in an elaborate ceremony attended by six foreign ministers, a brace of generals, a brass brand and hundreds of reporters.
0	3	Sir, dismiss your detachment!
0	3	French Maj. Gen. Francois Lann barked to a young American officer, who crisply led away the last contingent of military police.
0.230769230769231	3	The public was not invited to the ceremony on Friedrich Street, the avenue blocked by Checkpoint Charlie and its once-feared East German counterpart nearby.
0.125	3	Illa Wobig raised six children in a fourth-floor apartment just 20 yards from Checkpoint Charlie.
0.117647058823529	3	They saw it from their window for 24 years, and they saw it disappear Friday.
0	3	I saw eight people shot to death on that street, said Mrs. Wobig, 55.
0	3	I saw an East German officer try to go under a guard rail.
0	3	He was shot in the neck.
0	3	She said she saw at least 20 successful escapes.
0.117647058823529	3	Some were in cars and some came through a tunnel across the street, she said.
0	3	Some would walk very slowly, look around and just run.
0	3	She is not sure if one of the people she saw was Andreas Bratke, a 23-year-old East Berlin construction worker.
0.173913043478261	3	Tunnels, balloons, customized vehicles and other elaborate methods were used to flee past the Berlin Wall by desperate East Germans.
0	3	Bratke just ran.
0	3	I ran as fast as I could, he said.
0	3	I still cannot believe it.
0	3	Bratke is now a West Berlin engineering student.
0	3	He was taking his certification examinations this week.
0.0714285714285714	3	Eight months after Bratke made his bold escape, Sgt. Patrick Gainey was coming back from a party when he saw a huge commotion near Checkpoint Charlie.
0	3	This guy had driven a cement truck with his girlfriend and baby through the checkpoint, said Gainey, a U.S. Army photographer.
0.307692307692308	3	He drove a half-mile into the west side just to make sure.
0	3	When he stopped, he asked if he was in West Berlin.
0	3	The escapee was Hans-Joachim Pofahl, who made the crossing through a hail of bullets.
0.266666666666667	3	East Germany's border guards were as feared as members of the secret police.
0	3	According to guard Maik Polster, they were members of the secret police.
0.0625	3	I was with the state security, said Polster, 23, as he genially waved tourists through the East German checkpoint that is expected to follow Checkpoint Charlie into oblivion.
0	3	We had to maintain a certain level of appearance, he said.
0	3	No smiling, no joking.
0	3	We had to watch for everything.
0.117647058823529	3	The stone-faced scrutiny of the East German border guards helped give Checkpoint Charlie its chilling cachet.
0.363636363636364	3	The checkpoint went up with the Berlin Wall in 1961.
0.0833333333333333	3	With the wall being dismantled daily in anticipation of German unification, U.S. officials decided to remove Checkpoint Charlie with a grand flourish.
0.482758620689655	3	Secretary of State James A. Baker III, Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze and their counterparts from France, Britain and the two Germanys presided over the ceremony.
0.380952380952381	3	While the Berlin Wall is coming down, temporary barricades were put up to keep the public from the ceremony.
0.166666666666667	3	Several hundred craned their necks to watch from a half-block away.
0	3	Eilli Wiechies, 60, watched the pageantry from his wheelchair on the sidewalk in front of his apartment house, one of the few regular people allowed on the grounds.
0.0952380952380952	3	Finally, Germans can cross, he said, bitter that the Allied border crossing was reserved only for non-Germans.
0.216216216216216	3	A U.S. Army band played That is the Berlin Atmosphere, a stirring old song about the old Berlin, as the white checkpoint building was lifted to within 30 feet of Mrs. Wobig's window.
0.266666666666667	3	A sign saying What a pity, Checkpoint Charlie, hung from her sill.
0	3	I saw Kennedy, Reagan and Carter give speeches here, she said.
0	3	I saw a James Bond movie filmed here.
0	3	This is wonderful for history, but it is sad for me.
0	3	It was part of my home.
1	4	Checkpoint Charlie, the Berlin Wall border post that symbolized the Cold War, was hoisted into history today.
0.355555555555556	4	As a brass band played and foreign ministers of the four World War II allies watched, a crane lifted the prefabricated hut with its American, British and French flags and placed it on a flatbed truck to be taken to a museum.
0.228571428571429	4	Checkpoint Charlie went up in 1961 in the middle of the Friedrichstrasse boulevard after Communist East Germany erected the Berlin Wall to choke off a flood of refugees to the enclave of West Berlin.
0	4	checkpoint symbolized our conviction as allies that Berlin should remain one city and travel within it should be free," British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd said in a speech.
0.1	4	always hoped that one day Checkpoint Charlie would no longer be needed, and now that day has arrived.
0	4	At long last, we are bringing Charlie in from the cold," he added.
0.193548387096774	4	Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze attended the ceremony in a gesture of reconciliation with the Western members of the wartime alliance: Britain, France and the United States.
0.451612903225806	4	Shevardnadze, the first Soviet foreign minister to visit West Berlin, noted that the checkpoint was vanishing on the 49th anniversary of the Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union.
0	4	closing of this checkpoint offers further proof of a turn for the better in the international arena, for overcoming the legacy of confrontation," he said.
0.444444444444444	4	Foreign ministers Hans-Dietrich Genscher of West Germany and Markus Meckel of East Germany also attended the ceremony.
0	4	Genscher thanked Moscow for reform policies that had ended time of trouble" in Berlin and opened the door to unity.
0	4	Hundreds of excited Berliners leaned from balconies and windows today to cheer Charlie's exit, snapping pictures and clapping in rhythm with the band as the crane pried the hut from its moorings and swung it away.
0	4	Former West German Chancellor Willy Brandt, who emotionally challenged the building of the wall as mayor of West Berlin in the early 1960s, was in the front row of an invited audience.
0.111111111111111	4	Afterward, souvenir hunters ran up and snatched cobblestones that had served as Checkpoint Charlie's foundation.

0.18	0	Three decades ago, a West German politician said German reunification was a sleeping lioness that would awake one day with a mighty roar.
0	0	Now, there is growing speculation the awakening may be at hand to create a giant political and economic machine that could dominate Europe.
0	0	Reunification is coming closer, but I can't say whether it will take 10, 15 or 20 years, says West German conservative lawmaker Eduard Lintner.
0	0	We have the impression that things are much more concrete than we could have imagined five years ago.
0.620689655172414	0	The daily sight of thousands of refugees fleeing East German leader Erich Honecker's hard-line Communist rule for the capitalist West has revived international interest in the debate.
0.243243243243243	0	Once dismissed as a nostalgic daydream, the idea of German reunification has gotten a public nod from President Bush and something short of a categorical no from President Mikhail S. Gorbachev of the Soviet Union.
1	0	The idea makes East German leaders virtually apopletic.
0.104651162790698	0	If there were a free choice under the present circumstances in the German Democratic Republic certainly 80 percent to 90 percent would vote for national reunification with the Federal Republic of Germany, added the 44-year-old Lintner in an Associated Press interview.
0.5	0	The West German constitution calls for a united Germany, but it has not been a paramount concern of the West Germans in the years since the ruins of Nazi Germany were divided into East and West at the end of World War II.
0.264705882352941	0	Full national reunification would completey rework the postwar European order mapped out by the conquering Allies.
0.45	0	It is a prospect that creates unease in Britain and France, and in Poland in the East bloc.
0	0	London's prestigious Sunday Times on Sept. 10 mapped out a possible scenario that includes massive troop reductions in Europe, Honecker's death and further Westernization of Poland and Hungary.
0.346153846153846	0	Moscow unilaterally abolishes the Warsaw Pact after guarantees from Poland and Hungary they will not join other alliances, the Times' futuristic view continued.
0.428571428571429	0	West Germany withdraws from NATO; and a referendum in both East and West Germany votes for reunification and neutrality.
0.409090909090909	0	That sort of talk is being heard more and more as Moscow loosens its hold on the East bloc and countries like the Soviet Union, Poland and Hungary explore democratic reforms.
0.173076923076923	0	The implications of pulling down the Berlin Wall and other barriers to link the two German states are enormous and, for many, ominous.
0.2	0	As much of Western Europe heads towards its own unification in 1992, the economic center of gravity would be shifted even further to the German side with a powerhouse of nearly 80 million people 61.1 million West Germans and 16.6 million East Germans.
0.482142857142857	0	West Germany is already Europe's largest exporting nation, and despite its many flaws East Germany's economy is the envy of many Soviet bloc neighbors.
0	0	A unified Germany could become the political focal point of a continent already in flux, as democratic movements sweep parts of the Soviet bloc.
0.375	0	Older generations recall eerie echoes of Nazi dictator Adolf Hitler's boasting that he had brought about the unity of the German nation.
0.115384615384615	0	Eva Kulesza, head of research for the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe at the French Institute of International Relations, says she believes that as far as public opinion there is new sort of mistrust toward Germany.
0.75	0	This new fear of Germany is linked to German economic trends.
0.321428571428571	0	Germany is much stronger, much more dynamic than France, she added.
0.6	0	Since West Germany and East Germany are at the front lines of two competing alliances, any signs for eventual reunification would have to come from Washington and Moscow.
0.204545454545455	0	During a news conference last week in Montana, Bush said that reunification is a matter for the Germans to decide.
0	0	But he added: If that was worked out between the Germanys, I do not think we should view that as bad for Western interests.
0	0	For his part, Gorbachev evaded the issue during a news conference in Bonn in June, saying only, the situation in Europe today was determined by historical realities.

0.104651162790698	0	The Cold War was conducted in the name of freedom and, today, if the coming of freedom to East Germany brings a desire for unity which finds its echo in the Federal Republic, we ought not to be opposed.
0.109756097560976	0	Willy Brandt, the Social Democrat who sought greater ties to the East as chancellor in the 1970s, said German unity doesn't necessarily mean a single state although he called reunification a hypothesis that cannot be excluded.
0.160714285714286	0	As talk grows in the West, the positions against reunification almost seem to harden in East Germany, as people leave the country in near-record numbers.
0.333333333333333	0	More than 100,000 East Germans are expected to resettle in West Germany this year, leaving a gaping hole in the Communist nation's work force.
0.204545454545455	0	Little is likely to change in East Germany as long as the 77-year-old Honecker and his aging comrades stay in power.
0	0	During a September 1987 visit to Bonn, Honecker called respect for Europe's present borders a basic condition of peace.
0	0	Socialism and capitalism can't be any more united than fire and water, Honecker added on the issue of reunification.
0.195652173913043	0	There are virtually no indications that Honecker's successors will be inclined to democratic reforms, let alone joining the capitalist West.
0	0	The calls for reunification have already found a sympathetic ear among some leaders of the Polish Solidarity movement, in the country that suffered some of the Nazis' most brutal savagery.
0.121621621621622	0	After all, the abnormal situation of the German nation overshadows the whole of Polish-German relations, member of Parliament Adam Michnik wrote on Monday in the pro-Solidarity daily newspaper Gazeta Wyborcza, which he edits.
0.136363636363636	0	The renewed talk of reunification is recalling the nearly prophetic words of Reinhold Maier, a prominent West German state governor who later went on to head the centrist Free Democratic Party.

0.409090909090909	0	Tired and weak, indecisive people in West Germany are trying not to disturb her sleep, Maier predicted in 1955.
0	0	The lioness will one day wake up, blink, snap her her tail and start to roar.
0	0	Still, many in both East and West still agree with the 1967 quip by Nobel Prize-winning French author Francois Mauriac: I love Germany so much, I'm delighted that there are two of them.
0.25	1	The concept of a reunified Germany enjoys support from the United States and other countries but some analysts believe the consequences of a political and economic German superstate could have an unsettling effect throughout Europe.
0.397058823529412	1	The lifting of travel restrictions by East Germany on Thursday has breathed new life into the idea of a single German state, drawing expressions of support from the Bush administration and others.
0.321428571428571	1	But Soviet affairs expert William Hyland says that despite these assertions, a reunified Germany is really terrifying to most of the countries involved, to the West Germans, to the United States, Soviet Union, Poland and Czechoslovakia.
0.118421052631579	1	No one really wants German unity except the East German people, and they turn out to be the decisive factor, says Hyland, a one-time top aide to former Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger.
0.209302325581395	1	It was just 2{ months ago when ceremonies were held commemorating the 50th anniversary of the start of World War II, a time when a unified Germany initiated what was to become the slaughter of more than 50 million people.
0	1	While a recurrence of that nightmare seems remote at best under any scenario, an undivided Germany could become the unchallenged economic and political force on the continent.
0	1	The official U.S. policy on the reunification question was outlined last Thursday by State Department deputy spokesman Richard Boucher.
0.109756097560976	1	Reunification has been supported by NATO and by the United States for 40 years, and our strongly held view is that reunification or reconciliation between the peoples of Germany must take place in peace and freedom, he said.
0.3	1	As former National Security adviser Zbigniew Brzezinski sees it, the reunification issue will become very, very active if a freely elected government takes power in East Germany.
0.264705882352941	1	That possibility has been mentioned by East German leaders as part of the ongoing reform process.
0	1	Brzezinski asks: How do we arrange for the unification of Germany, so that it doesn't become destabilizing, so it isn't a threat to Germany's neighbors France, Poland, Czechoslovakia?
0	1	These are the issues we really have to very hard think about.
0.9	1	We have to think of a new structure between NATO and the Warsaw Pact.
0	1	That is our new agenda.
0	1	Theodore Sorenson, a top aide to President John F. Kennedy when the Berlin Wall was built in 1961, says he hopes a reunited Germany will be forged as part of a reunited Europe.
0	1	Reunification, Sorenson says, will pose problems, because we couldn't afford to have a reunited Germany outside the Western Alliance.
0	1	The Soviet Union couldn't afford to have a reunited Germany as part of the Western Alliance.
0	1	That's why I hope it will be a reunited Europe within which the reunited Germany can take place, Sorenson says.
0.473684210526316	1	Bernard Rogers, a former commander of allied forces in Europe, does not think reunification is inevitable.
0	1	Some form of federation, he believes, is more likely.
0.46551724137931	1	Rogers notes that Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev has said the nations of eastern Europe can do what they want so long as they stay in the Warsaw Pact.
0.428571428571429	1	If East Germany stays in the Warsaw Pact, NATO, with the best of its ability, would try to prevent full reunification; maybe a confederation between the two Germanys, but not a full reunification, Rogers says.
0.428571428571429	1	Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, points out that German reunification is a sensitive question for the Soviets.
0.225	1	Soviet policy is based upon preventing a reunified, economically strong and certainly militarily strong Germany, Mitchell says.
0	1	There must be some serious apprehension in the Soviet Union today, because the events of the last couple of days certainly has made reunification more likely.
0.136363636363636	1	The Bush administration says it does not foresee the dismantling of NATO under any circumstances but, according to Hyland, the reunification of Germany could mean the demise of the alliance.
0.321428571428571	1	It may also mean the end of Western European unity, because both have been based on a divided Germany and a divided Europe, Hyland says.
0	1	If that comes to an end and 80 million Germans are united in a confederation or a single state, it changes the entire map of Europe.
0	1	It changes all of the geopolitics and, in effect, ends the period we've been in since the beginning of the war.
0.264705882352941	2	Chancellor Helmut Kohl assured visiting U.S. senators on the eve of a superpower summit that West Germany will not forsake NATO to reunite with East Germany, one of the senators said Friday.
0.421875	2	He strongly affirmed under no circumstances would a reunified Germany be neutral, Sen. Richard G. Lugar, head of the American delegation, said of the Friday meeting with Kohl.
0	2	Asked whether he thought the West Germans were committed to staying in the NATO military alliance of Western nations, the Indiana Republican said: Without any reservations.
0.75	2	There is growing discussion in West Germany about German reunification as a result of sweeping social and political reforms underway in East Germany.
0.173076923076923	2	There has been speculation that West Germany might someday be tempted to agree to neutrality if the Kremlin stipulates it as the price for reunification.
0.6	2	Kohl on Tuesday unveiled a 10-point proposal with German reunification as its ultimate goal.
0.75	2	But the Soviets, who suffered millions of deaths fighting a unified Germany in World War II, have said the idea of German reunification is dangerous and unrealistic.
0	2	President Bush and Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev are to begin a shipboard summit off Malta on Saturday.
0.54	2	The dramatic events in East Germany and whirlwind reforms elsewhere in the East bloc are likely to be a main topic of their talks.
0	2	Lugar came to Bonn with eight other members of the U.S. Senate's arms control observer group.
0.173076923076923	2	He said the purpose of the trip was to visit with the Germans on their judgments about all of these procedures that are going on.
0	2	U.S. Ambassador Vernon A. Walters joined the senators for their 75-minute closed-door talks with Kohl.
0	2	The senators also met with Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher and Defense Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg during the day.
0.125	2	Lugar said Kohl told the Americans that reunification would be a procedure that depends on many events in Germany and Europe and that the Soviet Union and the United States have a role to play.
0.321428571428571	2	Lugar said of Kohl's proposals, There is much to work with there with regard to the future of Germany and the future of the alliance.
0.321428571428571	3	The government on Thursday allowed for the possibility of a reunified Germany, but said such a state must be formed gradually and respect Poland's borders.
0.132352941176471	3	In the Solidarity government's first definitive statement on the issue, Foreign Minister Krzysztof Skubiszewski told Parliament the two German states could be joined as part of the process of uniting Europe.
0.321428571428571	3	He said German reunification cannot go ahead of the reunification of Europe.
0	3	A reunited Germany will not be created tomorrow or the day after tomorrow, Skubiszewski said.
0	3	Fears and concerns appearing every now and then, including in Poland, are unjustified, although alertness is recommended.
0.128571428571429	3	Asked about German reunification at a news conference in Gdansk, Solidarity labor leader Lech Walesa said he prefers no political changes in Europe, but there should be all kinds of economic integrations.
0.5625	3	Western European countries have agreed to form an economic union by the end of 1992.
0.828947368421053	3	Sweeping democratic reforms have taken hold in East Germany in the past several weeks under the pressure of mass protests, spurring talk of reuniting the two German states divided at the end of World War II.
0.529411764705882	3	West Germany has proposed a plan for greater unity, but East German leaders reject reunification.
0.725806451612903	3	The specter of a powerful, reunited Germany has troubed many Poles, especially the older ones who recall the 1939 Nazi invasion of Poland that began World War II.
0.264705882352941	3	A reported surge in anti-Polish sentiment in East Germany in recent weeks has heightened Polish anxieties.
0	3	Skubiszewski's speech seemed designed to reassure Poles that the government does not see unification in the near future and will insist on Poland's current borders.
0.514285714285714	3	Skubiszewski faulted West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl's program for gradual German reunification, offered last week, for not making clear that reunification would respect the existing border between Poland and East Germany.
0.642857142857143	3	Some right-wing West German politicians have called for recovering the 40,000 square miles of territory that Germany lost to Poland at the end of World War II.
0	3	The territory is about one-third of present-day Poland.
0.620689655172414	3	East Germany and West Germany each separately has recognized the border, but there has been no official assurance that a reunified Germany would also acknowledge the border.
0	3	One can only unite within established borders and without territorial arguments, said Skubiszewski.
0.865384615384616	3	He also said German reunification is unlikely as long as West Germany belongs to NATO and East Germany to the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact military alliance.
0.519230769230769	4	The Communist Party today admitted that East Germany's socialist system has failed, and expressed support for a type of partnership with West Germany.
0	4	The statement in the Communist Party newspaper Neues Deutschland was one of the bluntest official assessments to date of the country's increasingly troubled situation.
0.225	4	It came a day after shouting matches broke out over German reunification during pro-democracy protests in Leipzig and Dresden.
0	4	Also today, Secretary of State James A. Baker III urged caution on the reunification issue.
0	4	He visited the Berlin Wall and met with West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl and East German Premier Hans Modrow.
0	4	In another development, the largest opposition movement, New Forum, announced it will take part as a political party in the country's first free elections, scheduled for May 6.
0	4	Neues Deutschland, in proposing a new party platform, said socialism has definitely failed as a social system in our country and acknowledged that the popular revolutionary movement of the past weeks had led to the scrapping of the old system.
0	4	The paper repeated the Communists' promise to work for a new democratic socialism within a multi-party system.
0.128571428571429	4	During the past few weeks, both Germanys have increased business and cultural ties but have debated what labels to use for closer relations, since the East Berlin government rejects calls for reunification.
0.45	4	Neues Deutschland urged a qualified partnership of both German states but rejected any suggestions of resolving the German question.
0	4	During Monday's demonstrations that drew more than 200,000 protesters, the largest of them the now-weekly rally in the southern city of Leipzig, speakers warned that the reunification issue could fracture the popular movement that has forced the ruling Communists into swift retreat.
0	4	One sign said Germany United Fatherland, using a phrase from the West German national anthem.
0.428571428571429	4	Others, opposing reunification, urged No Fourth Reich and no transformation of East Germany into West Germany's plantation.
0	4	ADN said 40,000 people demonstrated for reunification in Karl-Marx-Stadt, while several thousand people split into pro- and anti-reunification groups at a rally in Dresden.
0	4	Smaller rallies were also reported by ADN in Schwerin, Potsdam, Neubrandenburg and Halle.
0	4	The agency did not say if reunification played a role in those protests.
0.514285714285714	4	The rallies came shortly after the four victorious World War II Allies met in West Berlin to discuss the latest developments in East Germany and Berlin the divided city that they still technically administer.
0	4	The meeting brought together officials of the United States, France and Britain with Soviet officials, who have increasingly expressed concern over calls in both Germanys to reunite the country.
0	4	Kohl has advocated a confederation of the two Germanys, to be followed by eventual reunification.
0	4	But he stressed to reporters on Monday that the goal of our policies is not to create an overpowering Germany in the middle of Europe.
0.409090909090909	4	The West German leader advocates a reunified Germany that would respect the security needs and borders of the rest of Europe.
0.321428571428571	4	Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, during a Central Committee in Moscow on Saturday, urged the West not to try to influence developments in East Germany.
0.642857142857143	4	East Germany is a front line of defense for the Soviets, who have nearly 400,000 troops in the country.
0.195652173913043	4	ADN said Gorbachev would meet soon with Gregor Gysi, a reformer who was chosen East German Communist Party chief on Saturday.
0	4	Gysi's rise followed the ouster of two sets of Communist leaders.
0	4	Since East Germans began agitating for an end to Communist domination two months ago, public pressure has forced the opening of the Berlin Wall and pushed the Communists to promise free elections and relinquish their political monopoly.
0.195652173913043	5	President Mikhail S. Gorbachev met Tuesday with East German Premier Hans Modrow and appeared to be more open toward eventual German reunification.
0.128571428571429	5	Modrow told reporters after the meeting that Gorbachev did not rule out such a prospect in the future, and at the same time did not venture to set some time limits for that.
0	5	Earlier, the Kremlin chief said any such decisions must include the four Allied powers and take into account European opinions.
0.1125	5	The development of events in the world, in East Germany, in the Soviet Union demand deep consideration and an analytical approach to deciding this problem, he said in remarks reported by the official news agency Tass.
0	5	Time itself is acting on this process, giving it dynamism, Gorbachev said.
0	5	We have to act responsibly and not decide this important question on the streets.
0	5	Tass said Gorbachev emphasized that talks about restructuring relations between the two Germanys must involve all directly interested governments.
0.136363636363636	5	Asked by an East German correspondent about his attitude toward reunification, Gorbachev said the question was not unexpected and that no one can cast doubt on the reasonableness of asking it.
0	5	However, the English-language Tass translation indicated Gorbachev could have meant there were no doubts about reunification itself.
0	5	Gorbachev's position was similar to that adopted by Communists in East Berlin on Tuesday.
0	5	For the first time, the Communists acknowledged German unity as a long-term goal but said it must be imbedded in the process of overcoming Europe's overall divisions.
0.140625	5	The Soviet Union traditionally has strongly opposed any talk of German reunification, but Gorbachev has softened that position in adopting a policy that has allowed radical reform in Eastern Europe.
0.6	5	Soviets say the question of German reunification is to be decided in the future.
0.346153846153846	5	Gorbachev, in comments to reporters after meeting French President Francois Mitterrand in Kiev in December, reiterated his view that the existence of two German states is a fact based on the outcome of World War II.
0	5	But he added, The present situation is the result of specific historical events, a specific historical process on this continent.
0.409090909090909	5	So, history should decide the future of this continent.
0	5	I don't think it is a topical question today.
0.166666666666667	5	A different approach may create a situation that would complicate the entire European process, including the relations between the two German states, Gorbachev said.
0	5	Modrow said the two Germanys could work toward confederation in phases with no time limit.
0.1875	5	He said he agreed with Gorbachev that reunification must be decided not only by East and West Germany, but all of Europe.
0.09375	5	According to Tass, the Soviet leader said any action on reunification must not infringe on the interests of either East or West Germany, the four Allied powers: France, Britain, the United States or the Soviet Union, or anyone else in Europe.
0.25	5	Count Otto Lambsdorff, head of West Germany's Free Democratic Party, a partner in the governing coalition, said Tuesday in London that Gorbachev has adopted a more positive attitude toward German reunification.
0.3	5	In a TV interview on Britain's Channel 4, he also urged economic union within 18 months as a prelude to full union of West and East Germany.
0.236842105263158	5	Lambsdorff said that because of East Germany's political instability it had only two choices unification or chaos.
0.236842105263158	5	Modrow invited Gorbachev and Premier Nikolai I. Ryzhkov to visit East Germany and they accepted, Tass reported.
0	5	Modrow arrived in Moscow late Monday.
0	5	A Communist, he has moved forward the country's first free elections from May to March 18 and brought the opposition into a coalition that will govern until then.
0.3	6	West German officials and media today praised Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev for softening his view on German reunification and said it could give hope to disheartened East Germans.
0	6	Disgraced former Communist Party leader Erich Honecker was released from prison Tuesday night after justice officials determined he was too frail to withstand the rigors of imprisonment while awaiting trial on treason charges.
0.290322580645161	6	Gorbachev said Tuesday in Moscow that he believed one Germany was likely in the future, but he added that Germans should not decide this important question on the streets.
0.28125	6	He referred to the growing number of demonstrations in East Germany in support of reunification.
0	6	Gorbachev's statement was his most tolerant yet on the subject of a single Germany, which has been opposed by Communists for more than 40 years.
0.346153846153846	6	East German Communists on Tuesday endorsed for reunification for the first time.
0.173076923076923	6	In West Germany, Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher told West German Radio that Gorbachev had correctly analyzed the situation and again shown his political skill.
0.145161290322581	6	West German officials and media praised Gorbachev's view as realistic and described it as an important sign of hope for East Germans who have lost faith in their government.
0	6	Communist leaders launched their uphill campaign for March 18 parliamentary elections with a news conference to unveil their European concept that aims for a united and demilitarized Europe.
0.18	6	Party ideologist Peter Brie said the Communists support the togetherness of the German nation, and urged a thoughtful and measured approach to reunification.
0	6	In an interview with the West German Bild newspaper, party leader Gregor Gysi complained that the reunification drive is moving too quickly.
0	6	Asked if the Communists oppose reunification, Gysi told the newspaper: No, not at all.
0	6	This process cannot be stopped any more.
0.236842105263158	6	But it is irresponsible to do things in such a way now as if it were possible tomorrow.
0	6	The reunification issue promises to dominate the election campaign that will seat a new leadership in less than seven weeks.
0.46551724137931	6	Increasing numbers of East Germans have demonstrated for union with wealthy and prosperous West Germany as their own economy tumbles and an exodus of skilled workers continues unchecked.
0.214285714285714	6	More than 340,000 people fled East Germany last year, having lost hope that their spartan living conditions would improve.
0	6	The devastating flight has included as many as 2,500 people daily since Jan. 1.
0.118421052631579	6	The Communists are widely distrusted because of corruption scandals that have surfaced since the peaceful pro-democracy revolt last fall, and because they carry the blame for leading East Germany into its current economic and political crises.
0	6	The man most blamed for the country's problems, Honecker, was set free after an East Berlin court rejected a request that he be kept in prison until his trial in March.
0	6	He was jailed Monday.
0	6	The court decided that despite the severity of the charges against Honecker, the state of the accused's health does not permit imprisonment, the official ADN news agency reported.
0	6	A spokesman for Chief Prosecutor Hans-Juergen Joseph promised that the investigation against Honecker would proceed.
0	6	ADN said the court acted on advice from two doctors who examined Honecker independently.
0	6	Honecker, 77, underwent surgery on Jan. 8 to remove a malignant kidney tumor.
0	6	Honecker was ousted from the leadership on Oct. 18, after massive pro-democracy demonstrations.
0	6	He was expelled from the Communist Party in December and has since been accused of treason and abusing his power.
0.5	7	About 20,000 East Germans, many carrying West German flags, demonstrated Saturday for speedy German reunification, the official East German news agency ADN said.
0.125	7	As the demonstrators rallied in the southern city of Plauen, West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl said in Moscow that Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev had given him an unequivocal promise to respect German reunification.
0.45	7	Kohl declared it a very good day for Germany.
0.692307692307692	7	Kohl and Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher also disclosed that they expect a reunification plan with agreement of the World War II Allies to be ready before the end of the year for presentation to a pan-European summit meeting.
0.803571428571429	7	Calls for German reunification have increased since the ouster of the hard-line Communist leadership and the opening of East Germany's borders during the fall pro-democracy movement.
0.145161290322581	7	Despite reforms, nearly 2,000 East Germans, most of them skilled workers, continue to leave their homeland daily, crippling an economy already troubled by strikes and absenteeism.
0.409090909090909	7	Earlier Saturday, West German Finance Minister Theo Waigel said the East German economy was in a sorrowful state and urged the East German government to release details on its financial situation.
0.409090909090909	7	Waigel's comments came after a day after a high-ranking official in Bonn warned that East Germany is rapidly approaching insolvency.
0	7	Things are escalating, Waigel said in an interview with West Berlin radio.
0	7	The economy is in a sorrowful state.
0	7	The political authority is crumbling.
0.264705882352941	7	He said the Bonn government believes East Germany's foreign debt stands at $18 billion.
0.132352941176471	7	If the situation has changed, the East German government must say so, said Waigel, a conservative who has been pushing for establishment of a common currency for the two states.
0	7	Also Saturday, more than 100 East Germans protested in front of the Soviet Embassy in East Berlin against the stationing of Soviet helicopters in their country, ADN said.
0	7	ADN said the demonstrators held signs saying Gorbi, what about disarmament?
0	7	and Tanks out, helicopters in?
0.225	7	The protesters, from the East German town of Prenzlau, claimed the Soviets had backed out of disarmament plans by replacing a tank unit that had been stationed at a military base there with helicopters, ADN reported.
0	7	According to ADN, the demonstrators, who came from church and citizens' groups as well as from the town council, issued a statement calling for civilian use of the base.
0	7	Prenzlau, a town of 22,000, is located about 50 miles north of Berlin.
0.25	8	The chairman of the Simon Wisenthal Center has asked to meet with the leaders of West and East Germany to discuss the great fear that German reunification brings to the community of victims of Nazism.
0.461538461538462	8	I must tell you I am not among those in the cheering section applauding the rush towards German reunification, Rabbi Marvin Hier wrote Chancellor Helmut Kohl of West Germany and Prime Minister Hans Modrow of East Germany.
0.204545454545455	8	However, if that is the inevitable course, let us at least place on record our concerns, he said.
0.140625	8	Hier is the founder of the center, headquartered in Los Angeles, which seeks to keep alive the memory of the Nazi persecution of Jews in Germany and Nazi-conquered lands.
0	8	In nearly identical letters, he asked to meet with Kohl during his forthcoming trip to Washington and with Modrow in Germany next month.
0	8	The letters were made available Wednsday to The Associated Press.
0.173076923076923	8	You are undoubtedly aware, he wrote both leaders, of the great fear that German reunification brings to the community of victims of Nazism.
0.140625	8	It is not an irrational fear of the kind that one explains away as the nightmares of victims who remain locked into their past and lose all perspective of present reality.
0.290322580645161	8	The fears are real because those who bear the scars of the last Germany' do not see their concerns being addressed in the current reunification discussions betwen world leaders.
0	8	Hier listed 10 points he wanted to raise.
0.102272727272727	8	Among them were a program to teach German schoolchildren about the annhilation of the Jews; the creation of an agency to monitor and prosecute hate groups; the continuation of the special relationship now existing between West Germany and Israel; the convening of a 1992 conference of world leaders on the 50th anniversary of the conference at which the final solution was developed; the establisment of a German commission to protect Holocaust sites; the banning of terrorist organizations that have enjoyed respectablity in East Germany; a cultural exchange program between German and Jewish organizations; German television and radio programs on the reconciliation; restitution payments to the families and victims of Nazism, and a German commitment to revitalize former synagogues in East German territory.
0.236842105263158	9	Historians say the world need not fear that German jackboots will echo again on European pavements, but some still see the rush toward German reunification as a setback a step away from the integration of Europe.
0.519230769230769	9	For the most part, the historians say an East Germany collapsing into chaos represents a greater threat to stability than a united German state.
0	9	The West Germans are moving ahead not out of nationalistic fervor, but a perceived need to deal with a crisis, said Henry Ashby Turner of Yale, author of The Two Germanies Since 1945.
0	9	There is no such a thing as indelible national character, Turner said.
0.132352941176471	9	I don't think there is any chance that the young men of Germany are going to slip out of their Adidas running shoes and pull on jackboots and start running around saying,
0.183673469387755	9	He was one of several experts in German history discussing the implications of reunification following the decision Tuesday by the four World War II allies the United States, Britain, France and the Soviet Union to accept the reunification of a Germany they divided 45 years ago.
0.152542372881356	9	University of Chicago historian Michael Geyer, a native of Germany, said he feared the creation of a strong, sovereign nation in the center of Europe could reverse a more important development the 40-year drive toward an integrated Europe in which industries, banks, trade unions and even government ministries have been collaborating across borders.
0.9	9	The East German state is collapsing, said Geyer.
0	9	So something has to happen very dramatically.
0	9	But they have a choice the Europeans and Germans and Americans.
0.3	9	Do they want to opt for the European card or for the German card?
0.45	9	I think they are opting for the German card.
0	9	I hear these days very little about what Gorbachev called house of Europe,' he said.
0.1875	9	The result of a dominant uncomfortably strong German state, Geyer added, could be a setback to the diminishment of national borders.
0.195652173913043	9	It could also mean, he said, that American troops might have to stay in Europe as a counterweight to Germany.
0.1125	9	If I had my druthers reunifications would have happened after 1992, after the integration of the West German economy into the economy of Western Europe, said Charles J. Herber of George Washington University, expressing similar concern.
0	9	Then there would have been fewer chances for German adventurers, he said.
0.15	9	West Germans were aware of their European neighbors' misgivings, said Richard Breitman of American University, and so they presented reunification within the context of European integration.
0.321428571428571	9	They wanted to avoid arousing fear of a united Germany again dominating Europe.
0.236842105263158	9	Even if the history did not exist, there would be fears of that kind, he said.
0	9	We're dealing not just with rational calculation but a whole host of emotional memories.
0.219512195121951	9	For all that, Breitman said, One Germany is not only inevitable, but given the successful record of West Germany over the last 40 years, my feeling is it is better than having a regime in chaos.
0.18	9	The only alternative to reunification, added Turner, is an East Germany in ruins, a basket case, a Bangladesh of Europe.
0	9	He said Germans have no significant interest in territorial revisions.
0	9	Those misgivings are misplaced.
0	9	Gerhard Weinberg of the University of North Carolina, considered a leading historian of the Nazi era, cautioned that reunification, if mishandled, could prove explosive.
0.214285714285714	9	While the people of West Europe have gotten over nationalistic distrusts, East Europeans, living in closed societies, have not, he said, and fear of Germany is a reality in East Europe and Russia, he said.
0.125	9	I don't think the Germans are heading for Moscow again, but we have to give people and the Germans have to give people time to think this through and get used to it.
0.173076923076923	9	Mishandled, reunification could scare one or the other of the participants into starting something and scare others and goodness knows where it would end.
0	9	Gordon Craig, emeritus professor at Stanford, said the division of Germany has been the basis of a peace settlement which worked pretty well but was abnormal and sooner or later had to be corrected.
0.160714285714286	9	German reunification, said Craig, gives the world the chance to build a new international system, one that will prevent the use of international violence.
0.0652173913043478	9	He added, We have to be careful that we don't fall back into the kind of system that existed before the Second World War, a Europe filled with nations that were suffering various grievances, rivalries, disputed frontiers, driven by what they considered to be legitimate reasons but pitted against each other the sort of things that gave rise to Hitler in 1933.
0.140625	10	The Berlin villa where the Nazi leadership met to implement the final solution against Europe's Jewish population will be the site of a World Jewish Congress conference on German reunification.
0	10	The New York-based organization announced Tuesday that the meeting is scheduled for May 8, the 45th anniversary of V-E Day.
0.204545454545455	10	The world is expecting a Jewish statement on reunification, said Edgar Bronfman, the president of the World Jewish Congress.
0	10	I think that the place where they decided on the solution' is the right place to have such a meeting, and the anniversary of the victory in Europe seems to be the right day.
0.1	10	Some 100 members of the World Jewish Congress from about 70 countries will attend the conference at the villa in Wannsee, Berlin, where on Jan. 20, 1942, high German government and party officials adopted a plan to exterminate the Jews.
0.225	10	Jews have a right to state a moral position on German reunification and we will make a moral statement.
0	10	And part of that moral statement is to see that it doesn't happen again, Bronfman said.
0	10	In the long run, he said, a united Germany can be a very positive thing for Europe, but certain precautions must be taken to prevent a repeat of history.
0	10	For example, Germany's borders must be sealed in cement, and the country should not be allowed nuclear weapons, he said.
0	10	Bronfman said he does not fear a resurgence of anti-Semitism once the two Germanys are united.
0.3	10	In fact, he said, reunification might cause a decline in anti-Jewish feelings.
0	10	Now that reunification is about to be a fact, they won't be blaming the Jews for a divided Germany, Bronfman explained.
0.236842105263158	10	The conference will convene May 6 and a formal declaration on German reunification will be issued May 8.
0.145161290322581	10	It will be the first meeting ever held on German soil by the World Jewish Congress, which was founded in 1936 in response to Hitler's threats against Jews.
0	11	Sir, The argument for an independent central bank is that it should be free of party political interference, not that it should conduct monetary policy without regard to national, regional or global interests.
0.1875	11	Whatever policy the Kohl government followed over reunification, it was bound to unleash a large federal deficit and inflationary pressures in Germany.
0.254716981132075	11	As the western German population is now aware, German reunification needs a strong, growing west German economy to finance the subsidisation of eastern Germans' living standards until there is a sustained upswing in the east even if at the cost of higher German inflation than the Bundesbank would wish.
0	11	In Europe as a whole, very high real interest rates threaten to turn recession into depression.
0	11	The governments of Europe have been remarkably patient with the Bundesbank, although it is threatening nearly 10 years of European effort for greater economic and political integration.
0	11	Surely there must be compromise of some economic habits to achieve the latter?
0.125	11	It is ironic that, just when German reunification presented a short-term reason for Germany to shift its anti-inflationary economic and monetary priorities, accommodating European convergence, Bundesbank intransigence is threatening the EMU commitment.
0	11	Beyond Europe, the dominant economic forces are strongly disinflationary.
0.1875	11	But Germany is the one economy which, for reasons of reunification, could afford a more relaxed stand on the inflationary front.
0	11	Yet Mr Otmar Issing, the Bundesbank's chief economist, advises there are no grounds for a cut in Germany's interest rates.
0	11	This, despite the unreliability of German money supply data.
0.115384615384615	11	The German government might point out to the Bundesbank that monetary targets might be achievable only at the cost of many more than 3m unemployed in Germany, of the destruction of the EMU programme and global depression.
0	11	A DM exchange rate adjustment within the ERM is not the answer to the problems.
0.5	11	We need a prolonged low-interest-rate German reunification boom.
0	11	The European currency bloc is overvalued against the dollar and yen as a result of Bundesbank interest rate policies.
0	11	And this is aggravating recession.
0	11	A future European-wide central bank must clearly like the US Federal Reserve be more accountable in the broader European political and economic interest.
0	11	The governments and central banks of Europe and the G7 block including the Kohl administration should pressurise the Bundesbank, and be prepared to consider constitutional changes if necessary, to halt this idiocy.

0.195652173913043	12	West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl declared on his return from Moscow on Sunday that way is now free" for German reunification.
0.236842105263158	12	His meeting with Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev convinced him, he told West German radio, that the two German states should into negotiations as quickly as possible" after the March 18 East German election.
0.230769230769231	12	Kohl will meet with East German Prime Minister Hans Modrow on Tuesday and Wednesday in Bonn to discuss immediate steps in economic cooperation, including monetary union, to prevent the collapse of the faltering East German economy.
0	12	and economic union go hand in hand," Kohl said.
0.364864864864865	12	He said that immediate steps must be taken on the economic front to the hemorrhage of East Germans to the Federal Republic and keep them in their heimat," or home, in East Germany.
0.102272727272727	12	Kohl said that his talks with Gorbachev who told him that reunification is a matter for the Germans themselves to decide could lead to an breakthrough" in East Germany, which in turn could provide a forward" for all of Europe.
0	12	Asked how soon the two Germanys could merge, Kohl declared that the March election has to come first, and I think it will all go very quickly."
0.225	12	The chancellor said that almost all of the political parties and opposition groups in East Germany now support reunification.
0	12	And after the election, he said, will want to put their programs into practice quickly."
0.136363636363636	12	Gorbachev inquired about plans by West German politicians to campaign in East Germany, Kohl said, adding that the Soviet leader did not appear to be upset about such political activity.
0.257142857142857	12	West Germany's Social Democratic Party is expected to campaign heavily in East Germany in support of a fledging branch of the party that has taken a surprisingly strong lead in public opinion polls.
0.166666666666667	12	Major members of the party, including former Chancellor Willy Brandt, are scheduled to appear at rallies on behalf of the East German Social Democrats.
0.155172413793103	12	With the surge of the East German Social Democrats, political analysts are pointing to the strange role they could play in the ultimate political fate of Kohl.
0	12	Ever since reunification became a blazing issue, Kohl's standing in West German opinion polls has risen, and if the national elections, now scheduled for December, were held today, he would have a good chance of leading his Christian Democratic Union to victory.
0.160714285714286	12	But if the two Germanys are fused before the West Germany election in December, the growing number of Social Democratic voters in what today is East Germany who would presumably be allowed to vote in December could easily tip the balance away from the Christian Democrats, pushing Kohl out of the government leadership.
0.5625	13	The mass emigration of thousands of disaffected East Germans has rekindled reunification talk in West Germany, where some legislators plan to begin exploring the possiblity of reuniting the two Germanys.
0	13	No one is predicting a date for a possible reunification.
0	13	Proponents acknowledge the risks of assuming too much of East Bloc reform trends, and most hedge their thoughts with careful references to Washington and Moscow.
0.214285714285714	13	Yet growing signs of ferment in East Germany have given Chancellor Helmut Kohl's government reason to consider the possibilities.
0	13	Eduard Lintner, parliamentary speaker on German affairs for the joint Christian Democrat and Christrian Socialist caucus in the Bundestag, said his committee has placed reunification on its October agenda.
0.339622641509434	13	He said the sessions, which will include government officials and outside experts, hopefully can devise reunification models to discuss with West Germany's Western allies, particularly the U.S. has become clear to the world that the Communist system in East Germany is in trouble," Mr. Lintner said.

0	4	In this house, man and dogs speak as one.
0	4	Their relationship is unusually tender.
0	4	One need only listen while Wegman murmurs to Fay Ray and Battina, her 1 1/2-year-old daughter.
0	4	On Valentine's Day, for example, he said, take them out and play with them longer."

0	4	Battina begs to differ.
0	4	Bill leaves, Batty howls," said Andrea Beeman, an assistant to Wegman.
0	4	Man and dog
0	4	Their home is one floor of a former Orthodox synagogue on the Lower East Side of Manhattan.
0	4	During a recent visit, it was possible to see how the artist gets two even-tempered, relaxed, normal dogs to slip into florid housedresses or scratch each other's backs.
0	4	The three simply adore each other.
0	4	never heard of Weimaraners," said the artist, who was born 47 years ago in Longmeadow, Mass.
0.103703703703704	4	His life with Weimaraners began in 1970, the year he bought a new video camera and Man Ray, a puppy that cost $35.
0	4	Wegman had never photographed dogs before, but Man Ray was a perfect subject.
0	4	was gray and neutral," the artist said.
0.0823529411764706	4	could do him as a dog, a man, a sculpture, a character, a bat, a frog, an elephant, an Airedale, a dinosaur, a poodle.
0	4	I never got tired of him."
0	4	A dog's life
0	4	Had he been a different breed he would have been a actor," Wegman said, Lassie."
0	4	When Man Ray, who had become world famous, died of cancer in 1981, at the age of 11 years and 8 months, the artist mourned.
0	4	dreamed that he came back to life," said Wegman, who spent three years living without a dog.
0.186666666666667	4	was kind of liberating, the years I didn't have a dog."
0	4	In 1984, however, he got another Weimaraner, which was stolen.
0	4	Yet another dog died of Parvo, a virus.
0	4	In 1985, he got Fay Ray, who is now a familiar face not only among artists but among children who watch Street."
0	4	As a breed, Weimaraners combine lap-dog sensibility with a hunting capability," the artist said.
0	4	They curl up on his lap, but since they are pointers, they can hold a pose.
0	4	They are also good companions for an artist.
0	4	They are affectionate.
0	4	They do not drool.
0	4	They have style.
0.2	4	Like world-famous fashion models, these dogs are lean, supple and fit.
0.0875	4	In Wegman's home, which comprises 2,000 square feet with 20-foot-high ceilings, they live a life unencumbered one assumes by thoughts of fame or fortune, and seldom hunger.
0	4	Each morning Wegman feeds them Eukanuba dog food, which he considers the best around.
0	4	the highest in protein."
0	4	He often adds a spoonful of plain yogurt or cottage cheese.
0.4	4	The dogs eat again at 6 p.m.
0	4	The house is designed for both human and canine comfort.
0.233333333333333	4	There is nowhere that Wegman goes that the dogs do not.
0	4	The yard is a run of dirt and concrete.
0.1	4	If their master does not play with them, the dogs just scratch, sniff, get bored and go to the door to wait for him.
0	5	Go to court.
0	5	Such is the life of one German short-haired pointer, a show dog bearing the name CH.
0	5	Robin Crest Lorien Corniche.
0	5	Cory, as he is called for short, isn't any run-of-the-litter critter.
0	5	in his name stands for champion.
0	5	He has won 245 show awards as Best of Breed and 19 awards as Best in Show.
0	5	Basically, his problem comes from serving more than one master.
0.121739130434783	5	One of the dog's three owners thinks the kennel-club world has seen enough of Cory, who is four years old.
0	5	The other two owners think he has plenty of prizes still ahead.
0.07	5	In what is fast becoming a pit-bull match, the one owner, Anthony Attalla, is suing the other two, John and Rita Remondi, charging that they have been showing Cory even though he is officially retired
0	5	In the suit, filed in federal district court in Manhattan, Mr. Attalla says, has achieved the pinnacle of success and any further competition would only diminish what he has accomplished."
0.215384615384615	5	Mr. Attalla claims that his work with Cory is no gravy train.
0	5	In the suit, he says that under the owners' agreement he lays out fees and other expenses for showing the animal and he decides when to show or to retire Cory.
0	5	So far, Mr. Attalla says, he's spent over $125,000, the amount sought in damages.
0	5	In return, he is entitled to all ribbons and awards.
0.254545454545455	5	The Remondis are in charge of caring for the dog.
0	5	Despite the retirement, the suit says, the Remondis showed Cory twice recently.
0	5	For now, a judge's order temporarily bars them from further shows.
0.08	5	In a memo filed in court, Mr. Remondi claims that Mr. Attalla retired the dog and solely to better" the chances that Mr. Attalla's agent would win with a rival Rover.
0	5	The Remondis also say Mr. Attalla has bought a Rottweiler to show in another category and doesn't want to spend money on both Cory and the other dog.
0	5	They claim that Mr. Attalla has breached the pact by not paying certain expenses.
0	5	Stud fees are also at issue.
0	5	The Remondis argue that the retirement deprives them of their opportunity to show Cory, a dog who they assert in the best condition of his life."

0	5	His wife, Felicia Montealegre, died in 1978.
0.336	5	Flags at Lincoln Center, where the New York Philharmonic performs, were lowered in memory of the orchestra's first American-born music director.
0	5	Bernstein was appointed in 1958 and stepped down in 1969 to spend more time composing.
0.186666666666667	5	The Philharmonic will perform an all-Bernstein program beginning Thursday and continuing through Oct. 23.
0	5	The schedule had called for works by Shostakovich and Beethoven.
0.381818181818182	5	A memorial concert also is planned for Carnegie Hall on Nov. 14, the 47th anniversary of Bernstein's Philharmonic debut.
0.270967741935484	5	Famed for his gymnastics at the podium, Bernstein composed symphonies as well as movie scores and Broadway shows such as West Side Story, On the Town and Candide.

0.323076923076923	5	Larry Kert, who played Tony in the Broadway production of West Side Story, said Bernstein himself played the piano for him during rehearsals.
0	5	He could have gotten a rehearsal pianist, but he cared too much, Kert said.

0.622222222222222	6	For the New York Philharmonic, it was supposed to be a night of Beethoven and Shostakovich.
0.28	6	The fates made it a night of Leonard Bernstein.
0.233333333333333	6	The official catalog of his works says Bernstein led 74 orchestras.
0.4375	6	But this was HIS orchestra, and the musicians came to pay tribute to THEIR laureate conductor, who led them through 1,244 concerts during his 47-year association with the Philharmonic.
0	6	They let his music do the talking.
0	6	Tonight's concert is not an evening in which we want to dwell on the passing of a giant, but rather what he has left us, guest conductor Leonard Slatkin told the audience at Avery Fisher Hall on Thursday night.
0	6	So four nights after Bernstein's death at age 72, Beethoven's Violin Concerto became Bernstein's Serenade for Solo Violin, String Orchestra, Harp and Percussion Shostakovich's Symphony No. 4 became Bernstein's Symphony No. 1 written in 1942.
0	6	Also added were his Chichester Psalms and his overture to Candide
0	6	The substitute Bernstein program was being repeated Friday night, Saturday and Tuesday.
0	6	It was an extraordinary concert.
0	6	There weren't many smiling faces among the audience or musicians.
0	6	Slatkin's brief introductory comments, followed by the whimsical Candide, broke some of the tension.
0	6	Then came the eclectic Serenade, which Bernstein's program notes says is supposed to be based on Plato's Symposium.
0	6	It begins with a lyrical praise of the Eros, the god of love.
0	6	The piece is sometimes jocular, sometimes melancholy, sometimes assaulting and sometimes hedonistic.
0	6	It ends in drunken revelry, an intrusion of jazz as if Bernstein was looking down from heaven and telling the audience, It's O.K. to smile tonight.
0	6	The soloist concertmaster Glenn Dicterow played with much agility, especially through the difficult double stops and especially considering the lack of preparation time.
0	6	The mourning returned after intermission, but not without optimism.
0	6	Jeremiah begins with suspenseful strings, followed by a cantorial French horn, a melodic return to the strings and then a prophetic blaring of brass.
0	6	The second movement continues the point-counterpoint of brass versus strings
0	6	In the third movement, Jerusalem has fallen to the Babylonian king.
0	6	Judea is exiled.
0	6	How she sits desolate The city once so full of people She is become as a widow.
0	6	During her chanting of the prophet's Lamentations, mezzo-soprano Wendy White had to wipe a tear from her eye.
0	6	S did members of the audience.
0	6	Last on the program was another Hebraic elegy, Chichester Psalms.
0.646153846153846	6	The New York Choral Artists and a boy soloist joined the orchestra.
0	6	Two harpists dominated the center of the crowded stage.
0	6	Awake, psaltery and harp!
0	6	the choir begins in Hebrew.
0	6	I will rouse the dawn.
0	6	In the second movement an angelic 8th-grader, Evan Weber, sings King David's 23rd Psalm, The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want.
0	6	After he finishes, the men's chorus bellows: Why do the nations rage?
0	6	The piece, however, ends in a Mahlerian motif and chorus declaring a message Bernstein had sought for society: Behold how good, And how pleasant it is, For brethren to dwell Together in unity.
0	6	To emphasize the point after the final note, Slatkin suspended his hands for several long moments of silence.
0	6	Then came the cascade of applause.
0.7	6	For Leonard Bernstein.
0.233333333333333	7	On the stage where Leonard Bernstein made his sensational New York Philharmonic conducting debut 47 years ago, the orchestra remembered the maestro at a concert that included selections from his Mass and Chichester Psalms.
0.233333333333333	7	Wednesday's midday concert at Carnegie Hall also came on the 90th birthday of the late composer-conductor's close friend, Aaron Copland.
0.294736842105263	7	And it was the 36th anniversary of the first TV broadcast by Bernstein, who died Oct. 16.
0	7	Speakers, introducing various selections and often quoting from Bernstein's writings, included Bernstein's three children, son-in-law and friends Lauren Bacall and Schuyler Chapin.
0	7	Bernstein's daughter Jamie Thomas said her father had loved numerical coincidences and today there's a flock of them.
0.0682926829268293	7	The concert began with selections from Bernstein's Mass, which he composed for the opening of the Kennedy Center for Performing Arts in Washington, and ended with Psalm 133, in Hebrew, from Bernstein's Chichester Psalms.
0	7	Conductors were Michael Tilson Thomas, Michael Barrett, Christoph Eschenbach and James Levine.
0	7	The orchestra played the overture to Bernstein's Candide with a symbolically empty podium, which brought tears to some of the invited audience and a standing ovation.
0.35	7	Cellist Mstislav Rostropovich played a Bach sarabande.
0	7	Singers were the Westminster Choir, mezzo-sopranos Marilyn Horne and Christa Ludwig, soprano Clamma Dale, tenor Jerry Hadley and baritones Thomas Hampson and Chester Ludgin.
0.0848484848484849	7	First chair musicians from the Boston Symphony, Israel Philharmonic, London Symphony, Santa Cecilia Orchestra and Vienna Philharmonic flew here, at their orchestras' expense, to take part.
0	7	Two pieces by Copland were played.
0	7	The concert also included Schumann, Haydn and Mahler as well as excerpts from six Bernstein works.
0.28	7	Bernstein was the New York Philharmonic's 25-year-old assistant conductor on Nov. 14, 1943, when he filled in at the last minute for an ailing Bruno Walter.
0.21	8	Leonard Bernstein, the Renaissance man of music who excelled as pianist, composer, conductor and teacher and was, as well, the flamboyant ringmaster of his own nonstop circus, died Sunday in his Manhattan apartment.
0	8	He was 72.
0.266666666666667	8	Bernstein, known and beloved by the world as died at 6:15 p.m. in the presence of his son, Alexander, and physician, Kevin M. Cahill, who said the cause of death was complications of progressive lung failure.
0	8	On Cahill's advice, the conductor had announced Tuesday that he would retire.
0.116666666666667	8	Cahill said progressive emphysema complicated by a pleural tumor and a series of lung infections had left Bernstein too weak to continue working.
0	8	In recent months, Bernstein canceled performances with increasing frequency.
0.2	8	His last conducting appearance was at Tanglewood, Mass., on Aug. 19.
0.270967741935484	8	Bernstein was the first American-born conductor to lead a major symphony orchestra, often joining his New York Philharmonic in playing his own pieces, while conducting from the piano.
0.224	8	He etched other niches in history by composing the indelible Side Story" and teaching a generation about classical music via the innovative television series
0	8	Exhibiting remarkable talent and expertise in four areas that most artists wish they possessed in merely one, Bernstein still might have remained an obscure musician without the unique theatrical flair that dominated his personal as well as professional life.
0	8	With it, he became a personality, well known even to people who never bought a ticket to a musical performance or watched a serious television show.
0	8	The dervish persona, including his upstart gymnastics on the podium, never lessened throughout his long life in the spotlight.
0.509090909090909	8	He made classical music understandable and palatable to the masses.
0.121739130434783	8	And he lifted popular music to a higher plane, infusing performers and listeners with his manic joy in creating tonal sound.
0	8	conductors mellow with age," commented Times music critic Martin Bernheimer when Bernstein conducted the Los Angeles Philharmonic at UCLA in 1986.
0.0608695652173913	8	Bernstein, at 68, remains a frenetic combination of orbiting rocket, aerobics master, super-juggler, matinee idol, booming cannon, hysterical mime, heart-rending tragedian, bouncing ball, sky writer, riveting machine, mawkish sentimentalist and danseur ignoble."
0	8	Describing the conductor in the same concert, Bernheimer referred to him as shrugging, jumping, sighing, soaring, gushing, crouching, rocking, rolling, bounding, bobbing, leaping, jiggling, stabbing, hunching, bumping, grinding and grunting maestro in excelsis."
0	8	Critics also were quick to agree that had his envied and often-criticized showmanship masked lazy, sloppy or inept musicianship, Bernstein could never have remained an internationally sought-after conductor for five decades.
0	8	He knew what he was doing, and the musicians he accompanied, wrote for, conducted, or lectured to and taught admired him as one of their own.
0	8	Louis Bernstein was born Aug. 25, 1918, in Lawrence, Mass., to two Russian Jewish immigrants.
0.133333333333333	8	His father, Samuel Joseph Bernstein, was an entrepreneur of women's hair care products and a Talmudic scholar.
0.133333333333333	8	His mother, Jennie Resnick Bernstein, who survives him, said her son always had an ear for music.
0.164705882352941	8	he was 4 or 5, he would play an imaginary piano on his windowsill."
0	8	The parents preferred the name and called the boy that.
0	8	When his kindergarten teacher asked Bernstein" to stand up, he remained seated and looked around the room to see who shared his last name.
0	8	Bernstein changed his name legally at age 16, when he got his first driver's license.
0	8	His mega musical talent emerged belatedly and almost by accident.
0	8	When Bernstein was 10, a divorcing aunt stored her old upright piano with his parents, and the boy who used to play at the windowsill became fascinated with it.
0	8	He asked for lessons, and soon was playing better than his teacher, a neighbor's daughter who charged $1 a lesson.
0.0756756756756757	8	By age 12, he was studying at the New England Conservatory of Music and had determined, despite his father's objections, that music at that point playing the piano would be his career.
0.186666666666667	8	Bernstein's stunning instinctive talents for sight-reading, remembering complicated scores, and improvisation became evident as he played, and altered, classical, jazz and popular music.
0	8	He produced his own shows and versions of Mikado" and and performed as piano soloist with his school orchestra and the State Symphony Orchestra.
0	8	He reveled in music while excelling in athletics and the classical subjects taught at the 300-year-old Boston Latin School.
0	8	At Harvard University, Bernstein studied piano and composition, but developed a serious interest in composing only after meeting American composer Aaron Copland.
0	8	A fan and practitioner of his music, Bernstein met Copland in a typical it-could-only-happen-to-Lenny incident.
0.243478260869565	8	Invited to a dance recital in New York, Bernstein sat in the balcony next to a man he did not recognize.
0	8	Invited afterward to a post-recital birthday party for Copland, Bernstein commandeered the piano and played Copland's Variations."
0	8	His performance captivated the man he had met in the balcony, who of course was Copland.
0	8	They became lifelong friends.
0	8	Copland introduced Bernstein to several composers and got him his first job transcribing music for the publisher Boosey and Hawkes.
0	8	Ironically, Copland subsequently urged the torn Bernstein to make conducting, rather than composing or even piano playing, his career.
0	8	Conducting emerged as a possibility to Bernstein that same year 1937, his sophomore year at Harvard when he met the Greek conductor Dimitri Mitropoulos during the maestro's visit to campus.
0	8	Mitropoulos was so impressed with Bernstein's playing that he invited him to attend rehearsals with the Boston Symphony.
0	8	The maestro also talked with Bernstein privately in his dressing room after concerts, promising to keep in touch.
0	8	influence of Mitropoulos on my life, on my conducting life is enormous and usually greatly underrated or not known at all," Bernstein wrote years later, after his mentors had all died, ordinarily the two great conductors with whom I studied are the ones who receive the credit for whatever conducting prowess I have, namely Serge Koussevitzky and Fritz Reiner. But long before I met either of them, I had met Dimitri Mitropoulos and watching him conduct those two weeks of rehearsals and concerts with the Boston Symphony laid some kind of conductorial passion and groundwork in my psyche which I wasn't even aware of until many years later."
0.254545454545455	8	Graduated from Harvard and out of work after a summer in New York, Bernstein asked Mitropoulos what he should do.
0	8	must be a conductor," Mitropoulos replied, urging him to study at Juilliard or with Reiner at Curtis Institute in Philadelphia.
0	8	It was fall and conducting classes at Juilliard were full, so Bernstein went to Philadelphia for two years.
0	8	During the summers he studied under Koussevitzky, conductor of the Boston Symphony, at the new school Koussevitzky was starting at the orchestra's summer home, Tanglewood.
0	8	became like a surrogate father to me," Bernstein later said of Koussevitzky, his third major conducting mentor.
0	8	had no children of his own and I had a father whom I loved very much but who was not for this musical thing at all. And so I found another father: first Mitropoulos, then Reiner, and now Koussevitzky.
0	8	But the Koussevitzky relationship was very special, very warm."
0	8	Bernstein later became Koussevitzky's assistant and returned to Tanglewood annually to conduct and teach.
0	8	He so revered the maestro that he was married in Koussevitzky's shoes and white suit and always conducted wearing his cuff links.
0	8	It was Koussevitzky and fate who arranged Bernstein's meteoric ascension to world-class conductor at the unheard-of age of 25.
0.273170731707317	8	On his 25th birthday, Aug. 25, 1943, Bernstein was told by the Koussevitzkys that he should visit Artur Rodzinsky, newly appointed music director of the New York Philharmonic, at his Stockbridge, Conn., farm.
0	8	am going to need an assistant conductor," Rodzinsky told him.
0.0636363636363636	8	have gone through all the conductors I know of in my mind and I finally asked God whom I shall take and God said, Bernstein,' he said, granting the position as a favor not to God but to Koussevitzky.
0	8	Remarkable as his appointment was considering that he was an American and so young, Bernstein was given little chance of actually taking the podium.
0	8	In the orchestra's history, no assistant conductor had ever been called on.
0.311111111111111	8	But for Lenny" history made an exception.
0	8	On Nov. 14, less than three months after Bernstein got the job, guest conductor Bruno Walter fell ill and Rodzinsky was snowed in at his farm.
0	8	Jennie Tourel had sung Bernstein's Hate Music" at her Town Hall debut the previous night, in itself an event big enough to bring his parents to town, and he had played for her and the post-recital party.
0	8	With no rehearsal, a hangover and three hours sleep, Bernstein was to conduct a complex program broadcast nationwide on CBS radio.
0.14	8	The New York Times chronicled the epic event on Page One and stated in an editorial: Bernstein had to have something approaching genius to make full use of his opportunity. It's a good American success story.
0.164705882352941	8	The warm, friendly triumph of it filled Carnegie Hall and spread over the airwaves."
0.442105263157895	8	Bernstein was not to get his own orchestra until he took over the New York Philharmonic in 1957-58.
0	8	He had no time for one.
0	8	He was too much in demand around the world as the wunderkind guest conductor.
0.175	8	Successful as a pianist, composer and conductor, Bernstein, according to Joan Peyser in a controversial biography, consulted psychiatrists because of his internal conflict over the three pursuits.
0	8	is impossible for me to make an exclusive choice among the various activities," Bernstein wrote in 1946.
0	8	seems right for me at any given moment is what I must do. The ends are music itself and the means are my private problem."
0	8	The piano became an occasional solo onstage or a celebrated party pastime.
0	8	Bernstein concentrated seriously on composing while developing and commercializing his conducting career.
0	8	His first major composition, a symphony titled was introduced in 1942, and his first ballet, Free," and related first musical, the Town," both debuted in 1944.
0	8	He sought to be a classical composer, winning plaudits for symphonies sonatas, and the operas in Tahiti" in 1953 and Quiet Place" in 1983.
0	8	In writing music, Bernstein achieved greater success on Broadway, and even in Hollywood, than in Lincoln Center.
0	8	He followed the Town" with the musicals Town" in 1953, the score for the film the Waterfront" in 1954, and the critically acclaimed but less popular in 1956.
0.4	8	His best and best-remembered work, Side Story," debuted in 1957.
0	8	I can write one real, moving American opera that any American can understand I shall be a happy man," Bernstein said in 1948.
0.0682926829268293	8	When many suggested a decade later that he had achieved his dream with Side Story," he disagreed, saying: are moments when I think so, but as a sum total it fails to be an opera.
0	8	Because at the denouement, at the dramatic unraveling, the music stops.
0	8	I don't love it any less," he added, reveling in the adulation his adaptation of the Romeo and Juliet conflict had produced.
0	8	doesn't make it a stepchild or a foundling."
0.164705882352941	8	In teaching, his fourth area of expertise, Bernstein taught regularly at Tanglewood and won his place in academic annals with his Charles Eliot Norton Lectures on tonality at Harvard in 1973.
0.215384615384615	8	It was on television in the 1950s and 1960s, with his People's Concerts" of the Philharmonic and that Bernstein taught the nation.
0.0608695652173913	8	assessment of Bernstein must include his talent and contribution as a teacher and popularizer of music, a role that has set him apart most from other performers," conductor, historian and Bard College President Leon Botstein wrote in Harper's in 1983.
0	8	Instinctively adept at television, Bernstein became a prototype for Carl Sagan, Alistair Cooke and others now familiar on instructive programs on the Public Broadcasting System.
0.175	8	Bernstein's programs, Botstein said, his gift for analyzing and enthusing about classical music without sacrificing the integrity of the score, its complexity, or its simple genius.
0	8	No one before or since Bernstein has been so effective artistically and commercially in proselytizing and bringing alive serious music to a mass audience."
0	8	The television classics won Bernstein a coveted Peabody award.
0.35	8	Bernstein was able to apply his innate ability for commercializing his art that had made him wealthy to the struggling New York Philharmonic.
0.243478260869565	8	He introduced free concerts in the park and put the orchestra on television, widening its audience and tripling paid concert attendance.
0	8	He left the orchestra in 1969, after a record 11-year tenure at the helm, to have more time for composing and guest conducting.
0.116666666666667	8	If two rings of the Bernstein circus rested in popular and classical music, the third was anchored in his uproarious personal life.
0	8	Known for his emotional embraces of both sexes, Bernstein loved crowds and kept friends and family with him throughout the night at his Manhattan apartment or Connecticut country home.
0.096551724137931	8	A heavy smoker and drinker who partied or worked until dawn and slept until noon, he claimed he composed or studied scores even when surrounded by people.
0	8	knows, I should be dead by now," he said as he approached 70, characteristically cavalier about his health.
0	8	I stay up all night.
0	8	I'm overcommitted on all fronts. I was told that if I didn't stop smoking I'd be dead at 35.
0	8	Well, I beat the rap."
0	8	Raising the high-brow music world's eyebrows, Bernstein campaigned with other celebrities for the civil rights of blacks in the 1960s and against the Vietnam War in the 1970s.
0	8	Criticized for chic," his leftist political philosophy prompted him to host a storied fund-raising party for the Black Panthers in 1970.
0	8	In 1989, he rejected a National Medal of the Arts in protest of the withdrawn $10,000 grant of the National Endowment for the Arts to an art show on AIDS.
0	8	Although Peyser made a strong case in her 1987 biography that Bernstein had many homosexual affairs there was no question that he adored his family.
0.0636363636363636	8	On Sept. 9, 1951, he married Chilean actress Felicia Montealegre, and, despite a short separation and subsequent reconciliation in 1976, remained devoted to her and went into a severe depression when she died of lung cancer in 1978.
0	8	Bernstein is also survived by two daughters, Jamie and Nina, as well as his sister, Shirley, and brother, Burton.
0	8	Spokeswoman Margaret Carson said the funeral would be private.
0.195348837209302	8	Staunchly opposed to retiring, until last Tuesday, Bernstein continued his guest conducting, composing, and recording, perhaps topping his more than 200 records with the best of his best, a re-recording of Side Story" in 1985.
0.186666666666667	8	The effort became Deutsche Grammaphon's all-time best-selling record and prompted Will Crutchfield to write in the New York Times that Bernstein was in a class with Giuseppe Verdi.
0.243478260869565	8	French President Francois Mitterrand saluted Side Story" anew in 1986 when he made Bernstein a commander of the Legion of Honor.
0.175	8	After a nationwide series of concerts and parties celebrating his 70th birthday in 1988, Bernstein said with uncharacteristic modesty: have no further requests of the fates except for time.
0	8	I've achieved more than I had any right to expect.
0	8	Nobody has been as lucky as I have."
0.186666666666667	8	SUPERSTAR LENNY: Too much talent, too little time, says Martin Bernheimer.
0.14	9	Recordings by Leonard Bernstein, one of the most documented conductors in history, will undergo expanded release programs following the conductor's death on Sunday, said representatives of the recording companies controlling the late Bernstein's catalogues.
0.227027027027027	9	Executives of Sony Classical and Deutsche Grammophon, which control the bulk of Bernstein's recorded legacy, and BMG Classics/RCA Red Seal plan to step up timetables to deliver more Bernstein recordings to the marketplace.
0.133333333333333	9	However, most of the repertory will be from previously released recordings, including some made early in his career.
0	9	In fact, the only new recordings will be out next month as originally scheduled, reported Karen Moody, vice president of Deutsche Grammophon.
0.442105263157895	9	These are recent recordings Bernstein made with the New York Philharmonic the Vienna Philharmonic and Concertgebouw Orchestra of Amsterdam
0.221052631578947	9	At Sony Classical in New York City, Peter Munves, director of marketing, said this week that in January the company will begin its three-year release of Bernstein Collection": will release 75 CDs of Bernstein performances, including not only symphonic music by Beethoven and others, but also oratorio performances works by Haydn, and the Requiems by Berlioz and Verdi and other music never before released on CD."
0.215384615384615	9	At Deutsche Grammophon, also in New York, Wende Persons, director of promotion, reported: are looking at active DG discography, which contains over 100 different recordings, and making sure everything is available.
0.175	9	120 titles and some of Bernstein's own music, plus another dozen videos."
0	9	In his last years, Bernstein recorded exclusively for DG.
0.430769230769231	9	In August, Deutsche Grammophon released in this country a 12-CD set of Bernstein recordings with the Vienna Philharmonic, Israel Philharmonic and L.A. Philharmonic.
0.103703703703704	9	These recordings were made between 1977 and 1985 of music by Beethoven, Brahms, Bernstein, Haydn, Mozart, Stravinsky, Tchaikovsky and Gershwin.
0	9	Called Bernstein Edition," it is being sold concurrently in Europe in a 25-CD set.
0	9	Karen Moody, vice president of the classical label, would not reveal sales figures for Bernstein Edition," but said: can say that it is selling very well in this country, surprisingly well, given the U.S. market aversion to CD sets."
0.0777777777777778	9	In Los Angeles, Carol Brown, West Coast manager of sales and marketing for BMG Classics/RCA Red Seal, told The Times on Thursday that her label now plans a March release of recordings by Bernstein conducting the RCA Symphony in Copland's the Kid" and a suite from Bernstein's the Town," recordings made in the 1940s, and representing the conductor/composer's first commercial recordings.
0.143589743589744	9	BMG also plans, according to spokesman Carl Pritzkat, the spring release of an early Bernstein recording as pianist in which he plays Copland's Piano Variations as well as other recorded documents of the young composer/pianist.
0.254545454545455	9	The entire Bernstein catalogue encompasses well over 200 classical recordings and occupies more than a full page in the Schwann catalogue.
0.103703703703704	9	There is very little available on Bernstein in the home-video market, which is no surprise considering there are so few classical music titles on cassette.
0	9	Three tapes of programs recorded in 1971, all on Phoenix/BFA Films and Video, are out:

0.170542635658915	1	Mount Pinatubo, the Philippine volcano that erupted Saturday after six centuries of quiet, is likely to explode in the next few days or weeks with force comparable to the Mount St. Helens explosion, a U.S. government scientist said Monday.
0.130952380952381	1	think we could see a major explosive eruption any time," said Peter Lipman, a volcanologist at the U.S. Geological Survey office in Menlo Park.
0	1	Lipman is in daily contact with five USGS scientists in the Philippines who have been studying the volcano since April, when it first stirred.
0	1	A huge cloud of ash-laden steam rose up to 11,500 feet above the volcano today, spreading ash over a six-mile radius, the Philippine Institute of Vulcanology and Seismology said.
0.305555555555556	1	If it does erupt, the deadly hot ash produced by the volcano could sweep across adjoining Clark Air Base, he said.
0	1	Also in peril are the 350,000 residents of Angeles City, where the air base is located, about 50 miles north of Manila.
0	1	Even if the volcano does not erupt, the threat of eruption is likely to keep the base closed for weeks at least, Lipman said.
0.135802469135802	1	Scientists doubt it's more than coincidence that the eruption is occurring at the same time as the Mount Unzen volcano in Japan, he said.
0.523809523809524	1	The five USGS scientists are among the few remaining people at Clark Air Base, which was evacuated along with thousands of Filipinos living near the volcano.
0.0894308943089431	1	The researchers, along with 10 Filipino scientists and their equipment, today moved to a bunker on the east edge of the air base, 12 miles from the volcano, where they should be safe from ash avalanches.
0	1	Mount Pinatubo is typical of hundreds of volcanoes that make up the of Fire" on the Pacific coasts of Asia and the Americas.
0.20952380952381	1	Pinatubo's last eruption, 600 years ago, is thought to have yielded at least as much molten rock half a cubic kilometer as Mount St. Helens did when it erupted in 1980.
0	1	Until volcanologists' attention was drawn to it by a cluster of earthquakes beneath the volcano this spring, it had not been studied well.
0.146666666666667	1	Other recent volcanoes that erupted on the same scale were El Chichon in Mexico in 1983 and Nevado del Ruiz in Colombia in 1985.
0.0797101449275362	1	If it does have a massive eruption, Pinatubo's primary means of causing death and destruction would be hellish avalanches of hot ash 1,000 degrees or more, flowing and billowing at up to 100 mph, engulfing and searing all in their path.
0.141025641025641	1	the worst case, a really big eruption, all of Clark Air Force Base could be covered" with glowing ash, Lipman said.
0	1	Just being caught in a cloud of ash blowing off the avalanche is fatal.
0	1	That is what killed 38 people in Japan last week.
0	1	Such ash also would wreak havoc with the engines of planes at the air base, Lipman said.
0	1	Planes flying through clouds of volcanic ash indistinguishable on radar from rain clouds run the risk of having their engines stalled by the grit.
0	1	So far, the winds have blown ash away from the base.
0.159420289855072	1	But winds of the summer monsoon weather pattern, expected to begin any day, would send ash directly toward the base.
0	1	The volcano's activity measured by seismometers detecting slight earthquakes in its molten rock plumbing system is increasing in a way that suggests a large eruption is imminent, Lipman said.
0	1	The scientists also are monitoring tiltmeters on the volcano's slopes, to watch it swell as magma builds inside.
0	1	On clear days they fly above the crater to measure sulfur emissions.
0	1	Their predictions might be a false alarm the volcano may have done its worst already.
0	1	But it would take several weeks of declining quakes and sulfur emissions before scientists would be reasonably confident that the military could return to the base.
0	1	Volcanologists know of no reason the volcano's activity could be linked to the volcano in Japan, which is of comparable size.
0	1	reputable scientist I know of" is drawing a connection between the two, Lipman said.
0	1	More than 500 volcanoes have erupted in historical time, he noted.
0	1	out of 500 is no big deal."

0.236559139784946	4	Friday's eruptions hurled ash over Clark, 10 miles east of the volcano, and Subic, 25 miles southwest, where the Clark personnel had been temporarily housed.

0.407470288624788	3	Frustrated Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee say Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas is an evasive witness, but no groundswell of opposition to his confirmation seems to be emerging.

New treatments are contributing to fewer deaths from heart attacks over the past decade . Drugs , surgery , and tests to determine risk all show promise . Taking aspirin can cut heart attack risk in half , but can increase the risk of hemorrhagic stroke in some people . Post - heart drugs dissolve clots and limit the damage to cardiac cells reducing the risk of a subsequent heart attack . Angioplasty may be needed for fewer heart attack victims with the use of these drugs . Surgery bypassing one-third of the lower intestine lowers cholesterol and tests to determine levels of a blood protein can identify those at risk for a heart attack . 
New medicines and new treatments which have appeared in the last decade have significantly reduced the heart attack rate in the United States . The introduction of calcium blockers such as Diltiazem and Verapamil significantly reduce the damage caused by a heart attack while even the simple aspirin , taken every other day , also reduces heart attack risk . Aspiring , when taken with clot-busting drugs , has been shown to be especially helpful . Surgical procedures such as balloon angioplasty and ileal bypass also show promise in the treatment of heart disease . Even life style changes like smoking less or a better diet are effective in lowering the risk of a heart attack . 
0.25	0	New treatments that stop a heart attack in its tracks may help victims to get out of the hospital more quickly than ever before, perhaps even three days after their attacks, a study published today concludes.
0	0	Doctors from the University of Michigan Medical Center studied the effects of sending a few carefully selected heart patients home early.
0	0	They found that these people had no unusual complications, got back to work sooner and had substantially lower medical bills.
0	0	It was an extraordinarily safe strategy, said Dr. Eric J. Topol, the study's director.
0	0	There were no problems with any serious events.
0	0	Topol said the early discharges were made possible by two recent medical advances tissue plasminogen activator, or TPA, and angioplasty.
0.619047619047619	0	When given quickly after a heart attack, TPA can dissolve clots in the heart's arteries and minimize damage.
0	0	Angioplasty can produce similar results by opening up the clogged arteries with tiny balloons.
0.135416666666667	0	The report represents the latest in a steady three-decade trend of sending heart attack patients home from the hospital after ever shorter stays.
0	0	However, the study in the New England Journal of Medicine said more research is needed before the findings are widely adopted.
0.443181818181818	0	In the 1950s, doctors often recommended that patients stay in bed for one to two months after a heart attack.
0.147727272727273	0	When President Dwight D. Eisenhower suffered an uncomplicated heart attack in 1955, he spent seven weeks recovering in the hospital.
0	0	However, doctors learned that long inactivity did more harm than good.
0.25	0	Patients got out of shape, developed blood clots and became demoralized.
0	0	In the 1960s, the stay was shortened to three weeks and in the 1970s to two weeks.
0.232142857142857	0	Now, doctors typically keep heart attack patients hospitalized seven to 10 days.
0.125	0	In their paper, the doctors determined that 80 of the 507 heart attack patients studied were healthy enough to be considered for early discharge.
0	0	None of them had irregular heart beats, chest pain or heart failure.
0.65	0	Treadmill tests showed no signs of heart attack damage.
0.180555555555556	0	Forty patients were sent home after three days, while the rest stayed seven to 10 days.
0	0	After six months of followup, none had died, and the number of medical problems in both groups was similar.
0	0	However, people in the early discharge group were able to return to work about two weeks sooner than the others, and their medical bills were significantly lower $12,546 versus $17,868.
0.224137931034483	0	The researchers estimated that if 15 percent of all heart attack patients were discharged after three days, the annual saving would be at least $280 million.
0	0	In an accompanying editorial, Dr. Gregory D. Curfman, a deputy editor of the journal, cautioned that the study was not large enough to spot complications that might result from reducing hospital stays.
0.203125	0	This single study, he wrote, is not sufficient to justify sweeping changes in current management practices for all patients who may at first appear to have uncomplicated heart attacks.
0.0773809523809524	1	A drug used to treat patients complaining of chest pain also could help prevent recurring heart attacks in four out of five heart patients, according to a study published in today's edition of the New England Journal of Medicine.
0.524193548387097	1	Surprisingly, however, the study found that the drug, diltiazem, increases the chance of a subsequent heart attack in patients whose hearts pump abnormally, experts said.
0.348214285714286	1	Even so, the results may trigger an increase in the use of the drug, which is now primarily used to treat angina, doctors said.
0.282608695652174	1	The drug was tested in 38 hospitals in the United States and Canada on patients who had recently suffered a heart attack, said Dr. Arthur Moss, a clinical professor of medicine at the University of Rochester and the principal investigator for the study.
0.240740740740741	1	The results suggest the drug may be quite effective in decreasing the likelihood of a second heart attack in the majority of patients, Moss said.
0.560344827586207	1	But the study also surprisingly suggests that patients who suffer pulmonary congestion should not be given diltiazem because the drug increases the chance of a subsequent heart attack.
0	1	We now know when to prescribe this drug and when not to, Moss said.
0	1	That's what this study was all about.
0.295454545454545	1	Diltiazem is a calcium entry blocker, the newest class of drugs to be introduced in the fight against heart disease.
0	1	Nitrates and beta blockers are the other types commonly prescribed by doctors.
0.147727272727273	1	The study involved 2,466 heart attack patients, who were given either 240 milligrams of diltiazem a day or a placebo.
0	1	Patients were recruited from 1983 to 1986 and followed for 12 to 52 months.
0.154761904761905	1	Overall, the drug only decreased additional heart attacks 11 percent, which was not statistically significant, Moss said.
0.0928571428571428	1	But in patients who had normal or near-normal heart pump function 1,909 patients or 80 percent of the total group diltiazem decreased the chance of another heart attack by 25 percent, Moss said.
0.336206896551724	1	In patients whose hearts had pumping problems, the drug not only didn't help, but it increased the chance of a heart attack by 25 percent.
0.270833333333333	1	Dr. John Schroeder, a cardiologist and professor at Stanford University, said he was surprised that the drug increased the chance of heart attack in any group and that overall results were not higher.
0.147727272727273	1	But the bottom line is that this is the first study to show that diltiazem can be effective, Schroeder said.
0	1	I think it will mean that more patients will be routinely put on this drug on a long-term basis.
0.0984848484848485	1	Dr. George Beller, a cardiologist and professor at the University of Virginia, said he was also somewhat surprised about the increase in heart attacks in the group suffering pulmonary congestion.
0	1	This is one of the first reports that seems to identify that, he said.
0.196969696969697	1	Diltiazem and two other calcium entry blockers were introduced in the past decade, Beller said, and research into how effective they are in various applications is in its early stages.
0	1	Nitrates have been used for more than 50 years, and beta blockers were developed in the 1960s.
0	2	Aspirin sales jumped 41 percent for a few weeks earlier this year, not because of a rash of headaches.
0.75	2	A study of more than 22,000 male doctors had shown that taking a single aspirin every other day could cut heart attack risk in half.
0.104838709677419	2	The study was one of a series of recent reports showing for the first time that doctors are able not only to treat heart attacks but also to prevent them.
0.361111111111111	2	In the most recent report, doctors found that one aspirin tablet and a single dose of a clot-dissolving drug given within 24 hours can dramatically cut the risk of a second fatal heart attack.
0.26	2	Without the treatment, patients had a 13 percent chance of dying from a second heart attack within five weeks, the researchers found.
0.295454545454545	2	With the treatment, the figure dropped to 8 percent.
0	2	The real discovery is that treatment for patients is going to reduce in-hospital mortality substantially, says Richard Peto of Oxford University, one of the study's authors.
0	2	Heart disease is the nation's leading cause of death, by far.
0.382352941176471	2	The National Center for Health Statistics reports that 762,820 Americans died of heart disease in 1987.
0.39	2	To put it another way: Of the 2,127,000 American who died that year, more than one in three died of heart disease.
0.141304347826087	2	The drugs most responsible for the recent success in preventing heart attacks are the new clot-dissolvers and that old standby, aspirin.
0.423913043478261	2	The usual cause of heart attacks is a blockage of the coronary arteries, which supply the heart muscle with oxygen-rich blood.
0.232142857142857	2	The blockage arises from the buildup of fats, cholesterol and clotted blood.
0	2	Clot-dissolvers break up clots, thus restoring blood flow.
0	2	Aspirin interferes with aspects of the clotting process, helping to prevent clot formation in the first place.
0.25	2	The limited sales of the clot-dissolving drugs in the United States show that many doctors are still not using them, despite their proven success.
0	2	But that is beginning to change.
0.278571428571429	2	Some doctors predict that in the not-too-distant future these drugs will be judged so safe that they will be administered routinely by paramedics in ambulances before suspected heart attack victims even reach the hospital.
0.0691489361702128	2	We have to know how to respond quickly, and we have to have the courage to use these drugs in the absence of definitive diagnosis, says Dr. Burton Sobel of Washington University in St. Louis, a pioneer in the testing of the clot-dissolvers.
0	2	The most important thing we can do is teach patients in advance about the value of early treatment, he says.
0.3046875	2	While most public attention has focused on this new ability to prevent heart attacks, researchers have also made important progress in speeding the recovery of patients who survive heart attacks.
0.448275862068965	2	Researchers at the University of Michigan recently determined that some heart attack victims can be released from the hospital as soon as three days after their heart attacks.
0.382352941176471	2	Most heart attacks victims are kept in the hospital for at least seven to 10 days.
0	2	The patients given early discharge were able to return to work two weeks sooner than others in the study group.
0	2	After six months, not one death was recorded in the early-discharge group.
0.513157894736842	2	The researchers concluded that perhaps 15 percent of heart attacks victims could be safely discharged after three days.
0.0738636363636364	2	In July, Stanford University doctors found that workers who went back to their jobs about seven weeks after their heart attacks did at least as well as workers who went back after a more typical convalescence of about 10 or 11 weeks.
0.336206896551724	2	All of these advances come at a time when public health experts are increasingly emphasizing the role of good health and good nutrition in lowering heart disease risk.
0.40625	2	Early next year, the American Heart Association seal of approval will begin appearing on foods that are low in fat and cholesterol and therefore can help reduce heart disease risk.
0	2	U.S. Surgeon General C. Everett Koop in July issued his first report on nutrition, calling on Americans to lower their consumption of fats and to eat more vegetables, fruits, fish, poultry and whole grains.
0	2	The report has been likened to the first Surgeon Generals report on smoking, issued in 1964, which focused public attention on smoking's hazards.
0.135416666666667	2	Koop's recommendations largely echo those of the American Heart Association, but they should help carry the message to many more people.
0.325	2	Progress in research on heart disease is making clear that the heart attack is no longer a mysterious killer that strikes without warning and cannot be defended against.
0.13	2	Much can be done to prevent heart attacks, great improvements are being made in treatments, and recovery is faster than ever before.
0.541666666666667	2	The use of a clot-dissolver and aspirin could, alone, save 25,000 lives a year in the United States, doctors say.
0	2	These results, says Dr. Peter Sleight of Oxford University, will change medical practice worldwide.
0.08125	3	The expensive practice of using balloon catheters to force open heart arteries immediately after heart attacks, now routinely done at many large hospitals, is unnecessary and should be abandoned, according to a major study released Tuesday.
0.314516129032258	3	The study found that if heart attack victims quickly receive clot-dissolving drugs, they usually don't need the extra step of the common balloon procedure, known as angioplasty.
0.108333333333333	3	Some experts said the results are good news, because they mean that most heart attack patients can be treated in community hospitals, where angioplasty is not available.
0	3	The study also has an important financial message.
0.12037037037037	3	Its authors estimated that if angioplasty was widely adopted after heart attacks, it could raise the nation's annual medical bills by $704 million.
0	3	This trial has settled one of the most important questions in modern-day cardiology, commented Dr. J. Ward Kennedy of the University of Washington, Seattle.
0	3	The study is phase 2 of the Thrombolysis in Miocardial Infarction Trial, or TIMI-II, directed by Dr. Eugene Braunwald of Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston.
0.1015625	3	The first phase of the study showed that giving people a clot-dissolving drug called tissue plasminogen activator, or TPA, immediately after heart attacks dramatically improved their chances of survival.
0	3	The latest study, presented at the annual meeting of the American Heart Association, was intended to see whether people did better still if doctors tried to clear away any remaining blockages after giving TPA.
0.286764705882353	3	At 50 hospitals across the United States, doctors randomly assigned 1,636 patients to get angioplasty within two days of their heart attacks if tests showed there was any chance they might benefit.
0	3	Sixty percent of them actually underwent the procedure, which temporarily inflates balloons in dangerously narrowed heart arteries to squeeze them open.
0	3	A comparison group of 1,626 also got TPA.
0	3	But they were not considered for angioplasty unless they had lingering heart pain or abnormal exercise tests during their recovery.
0.209677419354839	3	After 42 days, 11 percent of those in the angioplasty group had died or suffered further heart attacks, as did 10 percent of those in the comparison group.
0.25	3	A year after the treatment, there was no difference in survival.
0	3	About 93 percent of both groups were still alive.
0	3	There does not appear to be any additional benefit from angioplasty, Braunwald said.
0	3	Dr. Thomas J. Ryan of Boston University Medical Center commented, We have the answer in this trial to a very important question of health care delivery.
0.125	3	While small hospitals can give clot-dissolving drugs to heart attack patients, most of them do not have the sophisticated labs where angioplasty is performed.
0	3	If the study had found that immediate angioplasty improves survival, it would have meant that many more angioplasty labs would need to be established and more doctors trained to give the procedure.
0	3	The watch word is watchful waiting to see if patients need angioplasty.
0.0855263157894737	3	This ultimately makes it possible for patients to be treated in community hospitals and be transfered to terciary care centers if angioplasty is needed, said Dr. Howard Morgan, immediate past president of the heart association.
0.216666666666667	3	Heart attacks occur when a clot blocks an artery that feeds the heart muscle.
0	3	The purpose of TPA and similar drugs is to dissolve these clots before the muscle dies.
0.464285714285714	3	To be effective, the drugs must be given within about four hours of the start of heart attack symptoms.
0.65	3	Experts say that only about 20 percent of heart attack victims are considered to be candidates for the drugs.
0	3	Many people delay going to the hospital until permanent damage occurs.
0.1625	3	In others, the treatment may be considered too dangerous because of recent surgery or a history of strokes.
0.4875	3	Balloon angioplasty is also widely used to treat people with clogged heart arteries who have not suffered heart attacks.
0	3	The latest study did not question the usefulness of this kind of angioplasty.
0.24375	4	Deaths from heart and blood vessel disease dropped 24 percent over the past decade, but it remains by far the nation's biggest killer, taking a life every 32 seconds, the American Heart Association said Sunday.
0.0792682926829268	4	The good news is that we continue to see an improvement in the death rate from the biggest killer of our population, said Dr. Bernadine Healy of the Cleveland Clinic Foundation, who is president of the heart association.
0	4	Those trends are dramatic and don't seem to be reversing, she said.
0.12037037037037	4	The bad news is that heart disease is still killing almost 1 million Americans a year, and we've got a long way to go.
0	4	The association released the statistics at its annual forum for science writers.
0	4	Experts attribute the decline in death rates to a combination of healthier living habits, including fewer cigarettes and better food, and improved medical treatment.
0.108333333333333	4	The public ought to appreciate the progress that has been made in heart disease over the past 20 years, said Dr. Myron L. Weisfeldt of Johns Hopkins University.
0	4	It's almost unbelievable.
0.382352941176471	4	There is almost no form of heart disease that we can't approach without meaningful treatment.
0.0955882352941176	4	However, Weisfeldt, who is president-elect of the heart association, also cautioned that much work remains, both in improving care and encouraging people to take better care of their health.
0.216666666666667	4	I believe we can prevent at least 50 percent of the ischemic heart disease in the United States by the year 2000 if we stop smoking, get cholesterol treated if it's above 220, and identify and treat hypertension, he said.
0.464285714285714	4	Ischemic heart disease is the clogging of blood vessels that feed the heart.
0.25	4	It underlies most heart attacks, the single most lethal heart ailment.
0.278571428571429	4	Association figures indicated that in 1986 the most recent year for which there are statistics an estimated 978,500 Americans died from heart attacks, strokes and other diseases of the heart and blood vessels.
0	4	Cancer, the No. 2 killer, took 466,000 lives.
0	4	Between 1976 and 1986, the death rate from all forms of cardiovascular disease fell 24 percent.
0.25	4	It declined 28 percent for heart attacks and 40 percent for strokes.
0	4	The association's figures show that more than one in four Americans suffers some form of cardiovascular disease, and almost half of those eventually die from it.
0.40625	4	About 60 percent of the heart attack deaths occur before the victim reaches the hospital.
0.295454545454545	4	Studies show that about half of all heart attack victims wait more than two hours before getting to an emergency room.
0.361111111111111	4	Weisfeldt said a major health goal is getting people to go to the hospital within three or four hours of the first sign of heart attacks.
0.270833333333333	4	During this period, there is still time to give them drugs to dissolve the blood clots that are causing their heart attacks.
1	4	This treatment can save lives and reduce the disability of heart attacks.
0.144444444444444	4	Other major goals, he said, include finding ways to improve the effectiveness of angioplasty, a technique that uses balloons to open clogged heart arteries, and finding surgical and medical techniques to identify and protect people at risk of cardiac arrest.
0.154761904761905	4	The heart association estimates that cardiovascular disease will cost $88.2 billion this year in medical expenses and lost wages.
0	4	Among other statistics released by the association: most common cardiovascular disease is high blood pressure, which affects 60 million Americans.
0.203125	4	200,000 of the deaths from cardiovascular disease each year occur in people under age 65.
0	4	were 1,418 heart transplants in 1987, almost nine times as many as in 1983.
0	4	2.5 million Americans have angina, the chest pain resulting from clogged heart arteries.
0	4	About 300,000 new cases occur annually.
0.270833333333333	4	many as 1.5 million Americans will have heart attacks this year.
0.541666666666667	5	A drug that eases the heart's workload can cut the risk of new cardiac attacks and death by 20 percent in people recovering from heart attacks, according to a major study released Thursday.
0.40625	5	The study, conducted in Denmark, found that the drug Verapamil, known as a calcium channel blocker, was effective for the 1{ years after a heart attack.
0.203125	5	Calcium blockers are among several classes of medicines commonly prescribed to relieve high blood pressure.
0.185714285714286	5	This is the first trial that indicates that a calcium blocker may be beneficial after an acute myocardial infarction, or heart attack, said Dr. Carl J. Pepine of the University of Florida.
0.448275862068965	5	Several other studies of calcium blockers, including one large U.S. study published last year, failed to find any benefit from using the medicines after heart attacks.
0.224137931034483	5	According to the Danish study, Verapamil is about as effective as another variety of blood pressure medicines known as beta blockers at protecting people after heart attacks.
0.39	5	While calcium blockers may not replace beta blockers after heart attacks, the researchers said these drugs still should have a role in treatment.
0	5	We feel it is important to have alternatives.
0	5	Many patients do not tolerate beta blockers, said Dr. Kresten Mellemgaard of Central County Hospital in Hillerod, Denmark, a co-author of the study.
0	5	Beta blockers are generally not recommended for people with asthma and emphysema.
0.464285714285714	5	This means the drugs often cannot be given to cigarette smokers, who are frequent victims of heart attacks.
0.12037037037037	5	In the study, conducted at 20 community hospitals, doctors compared 897 patients who got Verapamil after heart attacks with 878 people who took placebos.
0.108333333333333	5	After 18 months of followup, there were 146 deaths or recurring heart attacks among the Verapamil patients, compared with 180 in people who got the dummy medication.
0	5	We wanted to see if an effect would be observed with Verapamil, said Dr. Forgen Fischer Hansen of Copenhagen Municipal Hospital.
0	5	If it had an effect, it should be seen in the first 12 to 18 months, because there is a big increase in mortality in myocardial infarction in this period, he said.
0	5	Then it levels off.
0	5	That's what we demonstrated.
0.416666666666667	5	The researchers believe that by reducing the amount of work needed by the heart to sustain circulation, calcium blockers lowered the chances of ischemia, episodes in which the heart's own muscle is deprived of oxygen.
0.4875	5	They said they were unsure why earlier studies failed to show any benefit from calcium blockers after heart attacks.
0	5	However, they noted that some studies enrolled patients who were also taking beta blockers.
0.295454545454545	5	And this might have obscured any benefits from calcium blockers.
0	5	The results were presented at a meeting of the American College of Cardiology.
0.065	5	Among other research described at the meeting: James H. Chesebro of the Mayo Clinic said a five-year study found that aspirin does not stop the continued buildup of existing blockages in the arteries feeding the heart, although it may modestly protect against the development of new deposits.
0.855263157894737	5	However, like other studies, this one found that aspirin signficantly cut the risk of heart attacks.
0	5	Eugene Braunwald of Harvard Medical School said the next phase of a large study of clot-dissolving drugs will see what effect they have in unstable angina.
0	5	This is a condition in which people suffer spontaneous chest pain that is not triggered by work or stress.
0.464285714285714	5	Until now, the drugs have been used only to treat heart attacks.
0.492424242424242	6	A natural substance called transforming growth factor beta appears to be able to limit damage to cardiac cells following a heart attack, according to a study published in the journal Science.
0.0722222222222222	6	In a study at the Jefferson Medical College in Philadelphia, a group of laboratory rats induced to have heart attacks suffered 50 percent less cell damage after injections of transforming growth factor beta than did rats that did not receive the TGF beta.
0.224137931034483	6	TGF beta is a growth factor that opposes some of the bad guys following a heart attack, said Dr. Allan M. Lefer, a professor at Jefferson.
0.1625	6	Lefer said his research team simulated heart attacks in 24 rats by partially blocking key arteries in their hearts.
0	6	In 12 of the rats, the researchers injected a placebo.
0	6	In the other 12, they injected transforming growth factor beta.
0.154761904761905	6	For those who received the TGF beta, said Lefer, the damage from the attack was much less severe.
0	6	There was about 50 percent less injury with TGF beta than without it.
0.423913043478261	6	The extent of heart cell damage was determined by measuring the amount of creatine kinase in the heart tissue following an attack.
0.270833333333333	6	Hearts damaged when the blood supply is interrupted, as in a heart attack, tend to lose creatine kinase, said Lefer.
0.1625	6	Thus, by measuring for the loss of this substance, researchers could determine the amount of heart damage.
0.3046875	6	Lefer said the TGF beta seems to block the action of other substances, such as tumor necrosis factor, that can cause blood vessels to narrow following a heart attack.
0.513157894736842	6	Narrowed blood vessels carry less oxygen-rich blood to cells and this causes additional injury following a heart attack.
0.209677419354839	6	TGF beta is normally present in heart cells, but the study published in Science said that it is missing from rat heart cells damaged by a simulated heart attack.
0	6	Though TGF beta is produced naturally in the body, Lefer said his research team used a substance produced artificially by Genentech, a California biotechnology firm.
0.40625	6	Lefer said his team is now conducting additional studies with TGF beta and that any experimental treatment of human heart attack victims with the substance is at least a year away.
0	6	Jefferson Medical College, where the study was done, is part of Thomas Jefferson University in Philadelphia.
0	6	Science, which published the study, is the journal of the American Association for the Advancement of Science.
0.928571428571428	7	An intestinal operation to lower the cholesterol of heart attack patients reduced their risk for another heart attack or death from heart disease, researchers said today.
0.282608695652174	7	The surgery, called a partial ileal bypass, has one significant drawback: It causes chronic diarrhea that persists for years.
0.1625	7	In the operation, doctors change the route of the small intestine so about one-third of it is bypassed.
0.25	7	This reduces the amount of cholesterol that is absorbed into the bloodstream.
0.361111111111111	7	The $52 million, 17-year study was conducted on people who had already suffered heart attacks.
0.147727272727273	7	The approach lengthened the lives of people who had very mild heart attacks but not those with more severe heart damage.
0	7	During an average of 10 years of follow up, the death rate among surgery patients who had sustained minimal heart damage was 24 percent.
0.232142857142857	7	In a comparison group without the intestinal surgery, it was 39 percent.
0	7	Dr. Henry Buchwald of the University of Minnesota, who directed the study, said the surgery should be considered along with cholesterol-lowering drugs as a possible standard treatment.
0.295454545454545	7	It has a role in the management of patients with high cholesterol who have had a heart attack, Buchwald said.
0.375	7	It is eminently logical to extend all cholesterol-lowering therapy, including this, to patients with high cholesterol who have not had a heart attack.
0	7	Besides diarrhea, those who undergo the surgery are somewhat more prone to have kidney stones, gallstones and intestinal obstructions.
0	7	The study was conducted in Minneapolis, Los Angeles, Philadelphia and Little Rock, Ark., and published in today's New England Journal of Medicine.
0	7	Despite wide acceptance of cholesterol lowering, doubts remain about whether it actually helps people live longer if they already have healthy hearts.
0.125	7	Although the latest study was conducted exclusively on people who had suffered heart attacks, Buchwald said he believes the research should settle that question.
0	7	It offers the strongest justification for marked lipid ineervention that has ever been offered, Buchwald said.
0	7	It is a very powerful study and should, except for certain people who will never be satisfied, end the cholesterol controversy.
0.348214285714286	7	In the study, 421 people who recovered from heart attacks underwent the surgery, while a comparison group of 417 people were treated with diet alone.
0	7	At the start of the study, their average cholesterol levels were 251.
0	7	The surgery lowered people's cholesterol 23 percent.
0.481481481481481	7	The overall risk of dying from heart disease or suffering another non-fatal heart attack was reduced 35 percent among the surgical patients with the healthiest hearts.
0	7	The surgical patients also required less than half as many coronary bypass operations because of clogged heart arteries.
0.240740740740741	8	Doctors should be cautious in prescribing aspirin as a preventer of heart attacks until more research supports its value, the Food and Drug Administration said.
0.342105263157895	8	Taking aspirin to prevent heart attacks may increase some people's chances of dying of other things, especially hemorrhagic strokes, the agency said in a commentary in today's Journal of the American Medical Association.
0.13	8	The FDA persuaded aspirin makers in March to refrain from promoting aspirin as a preventer of first heart attacks, at least for now.
0.416666666666667	8	A study published in January indicated an aspirin every other day reduced the risk of nonfatal, first heart attacks 47% in 11,000 male doctors over five years, compared with 11,000 who took a non-aspirin substitute.
0.191176470588235	8	Aspirin tends to promote bleeding by reducing the ability of blood platelets to help form clots.
0.1625	8	Heart attacks usually occur when clots form in the arteries nourishing the heart and choke off its blood supply.
0.256578947368421	8	But aspirin may increase health risks for people who already have clotting problems, or for those who have high blood pressure, which puts them at increased risk for hemorrhagic strokes, the FDA commentary said.
0.5	8	Strokes are the result of brain damage caused by bleeding in the brain or by blood clots; hemorrhagic strokes are those caused by bleeding.
0.203125	8	The FDA commentary pointed to 10 hemorrhagic strokes recorded among the 11,000 subjects taking aspirin in the recent study, compared with two such strokes among 11,000 subjects taking the substitute.
0	8	Overall death rates for the two groups were the same, though the aspirin group's nonfatal heart-attack rate was much lower.
0.191176470588235	8	There were 104 nonfatal heart attacks among the aspirin users and 189 in the comparison group.
0	8	will, for a time, be forced to make their professional judgments about aspirin use on the basis of incomplete information," said the FDA commentary, co-written by agency Director Dr. Frank E. Young.
0	8	agree with them completely," said Dr. Julie Buring, a Harvard University researcher who participated in the aspirin study.
0	8	She added in a telephone interview yesterday that an extension of the study is under way, and researchers expect to report to the FDA in late fall.
0.0773809523809524	8	The commentary noted a British study, also released in January, of 5,000 male physicians that found that aspirin failed to protect against heart attacks, and that it was associated with a 2 1/2-fold increase in disabling strokes.
0.419354838709677	9	NEW YORK An experiment with more than 1,700 high blood pressure patients showed that a blood and urine test can pinpoint those patients most likely to have a heart attack.
0.203125	9	The experiment suggests that doctors could test their patients with mild to moderate high blood pressure to determine how intensively they should be treated to prevent heart attacks, researchers said.
0.5	9	The experiment indicated that the test can spot those patients with extremely low risk of heart attack as well as those with a high risk.
0.40625	9	The experiment also hinted that the blood and urine test, which measures the activity of a blood protein called renin, might suggest a new factor" for heart attacks.
0.24375	9	About half of the 1.5 million Americans who suffer a heart attack each year don't have the known risk factors for heart disease, such as high cholesterol levels, cigarette smoking, obesity and high blood pressure.
0.361111111111111	9	It is unknown what distinguishes these seemingly healthy people from those who don't suffer heart attacks.
0.166666666666667	9	The blood and urine test is already being done in many commercial laboratories but for medical conditions other than heart attack risk, said John H. Laragh of the Cardiovascular Center at Cornell University and New York Hospital.
0	9	our hands, it cost about $40 and in other labs it may cost the patient $40 to $80," he said.
0.141304347826087	9	Dr. Laragh pioneered the research underlying use of the test, which was developed by his wife, biochemist Jean E. Sealey.
0	9	The test, which isn't patented, is available in kit form to laboratories.
0	9	The blood portion of the test determines whether the kidneys are releasing renin into the blood stream and how active the chemical is.
0	9	The release of renin is the first step in a rapid chemical chain reaction that raises blood pressure.
0	9	The urine portion of the test tells how much salt is in the bloodstream.
0	9	A high concentration of salt in the blood also raises pressure.
0	9	The test is based on the fact that if the salt concentration in the blood rises, tending to boost blood pressure, the activity of the renin normally drops to offset the effect of the salt.
0.203125	9	The new experiment was designed to test a theory put forth by Dr. Laragh and his colleagues that the activity of the renin in the blood foretells a possible heart attack.
0	9	The theory has provoked sometimes furious controversy for almost 20 years.
0	9	The Cornell cardiologist has argued that in many people with high blood pressure the activity of the renin in the blood is much higher than is warranted by the amount of salt in the blood.
0.928571428571428	9	Such renin" people are at a high risk of a heart attack.
0	9	On the other hand, in other patients with high blood pressure, the activity of the renin is much lower than is warranted by the degree of salt in the blood.
0.541666666666667	9	These renin" people are at a low risk of heart attack, Dr. Laragh has maintained.
0	9	In the experiment, blood and urine samples were obtained at New York City offices and factories from 1,717 workers found to have mild to moderate high blood pressure.
0	9	The patients' high blood pressure was initially discovered in a screening program carried out by Michael H. Alderman and his colleagues at Albert Einstein College of Medicine, who operate a work-site blood pressure control program in cooperation with local unions.
0	9	In 1981, Dr. Laragh's group began testing the renin activity in blood and urine samples collected by Dr. Alderman's team.
0.361111111111111	9	They kept track of the workers for more than eight years to see which had heart attacks.
0	9	The results, published in this week's New England Journal of Medicine, lend strong support to Dr. Laragh's theory.
0	9	Only 12% of the patients had high renin
0.448275862068965	9	But the seven heart attacks in this small group constituted the highest incidence of heart attacks among the patients, 13 heart attacks per 1,000 person-years of observation.
0.0590909090909091	9	The incidence in the high renin patients was more than double the incidence in those with a normal renin profile 5.3 heart attacks per 1,000 person-years and more than triple that of the patients with a low renin profile, 3.3 per 1,000 person-years, Drs. Alderman, Laragh and their respective colleagues reported.
0.348214285714286	9	Regardless of how the statisticians broke down the patients into various groups, those with high renin profiles almost invariably had the highest incidence of heart attacks.
0.1015625	9	Smokers had more heart attacks than nonsmokers, but the incidence of attacks in smokers with high renin profiles was more than six times that in smokers with low renin profiles.
0	9	the real dynamite is in the patients who didn't have any of the usual risk factors," Dr. Laragh said in an interview.
0	9	Among patients who had normal blood cholesterol level and were free of diabetes, with high renin profiles were seven times more likely to have a myocardial infarction attack} than those with normal or low renin profiles," the researchers wrote.
0.135416666666667	9	There were no heart attacks among the 240 patients with low renin profiles who had no risk factors other than high blood pressure.
0.361111111111111	9	To Dr. Laragh, this suggests that a high renin profile might signal a high risk of heart attack even for people without high blood pressure.
0	9	think everybody should have this simple and accurate test," he said in the interview.
0.8125	9	a new window into heart disease."
0.40625	9	In an accompanying editorial, Victor J. Dzau of Stanford University medical school said the study shows that the renin profile test is useful" in identifying high blood pressure patients who are at risk of a heart attack.
0	9	But, he wrote, larger, population-based study will be important in confirming the results of this paper."
0	9	The experiment has implications for drug makers as well as patients.
0	9	Apparently by coincidence, Abbott Laboratories announced on Tuesday that is developing a high blood pressure drug that works by inhibiting the activity of renin.
0	9	Other major drug makers are thought to also be working on renin inhibitors.
1	9	The experiment hints these drugs might also protect patients from heart attacks.
0.0722222222222222	9	A big-selling class of high blood pressure drugs, including Bristol-Myers Squibb Corp.'s Capoten and Merck Co.'s Vasotec, are known as ACE inhibitors because they work by stopping renin in the blood from being converted to a second chemical called angiotensin.
0.141304347826087	9	Studies are under way to see if these ACE inhibitors protect patients against heart attacks as well as lower their blood pressure.

0	2	She later wrote him a Dear Ron letter in which she praised him as a great president, one of the greatest.
0	2	Like Reagan, she was deeply suspicious of the Soviet Union.
0	2	Together they advocated a hard line toward Moscow and championed military readiness even though she was the first to recognize Mikhail S. Gorbachev as a leader she could do business with.
0.222222222222222	2	Mrs. Thatcher encouraged the huge Pentagon buildup that Reagan nurtured under the theme of peace through strength.
0	2	She was a big backer of U.S. efforts to install medium-range missiles in Europe and always seemed cautious perhaps reluctant when it came to disarmament.
0	2	When Argentina and Britain clashed militarily over the Falkland Islands, the United States was forced to make a painful choice between two allies.

0.181818181818182	2	The Berlin Wall was collapsing and it appeared as if Bush found German Chancellor Helmut Kohl more interesting than Mrs. Thatcher.
0	2	She was merely one in a parade of foreign dignitaries who got the prized invitation to visit Bush at Camp David this year.
0.173913043478261	2	Nevertheless, Bush said he expected the special relationship between the United States and Great Britain to remain on a steady keel.
0.4	2	Mrs. Thatcher did her part, demonstrating her loyalty.
0	2	For awhile she and Bush were seemingly alone in their suspicions of Gorbachev's unilateral cutbacks in troops and arms in Europe, and appeared uncertain how to respond.
0	2	Under intense pressure from Congress, Bush began to warm to the Soviet leader.
0	2	Now they seem almost best of friends.
0	2	On the Persian Gulf, Bush said he would not rule out possible military force, and ordered a huge buildup of troops to make his threat credible.
0.5	2	Mrs. Thatcher, characteristically, was tougher.
0	2	She said that unless Saddam Hussein got out of Kuwait soon, the West would have to use military force to dislodge him.
0	2	She called Saddam a loser, and the state-controlled Iraqi news agency replied that she was an old hag.
0	2	Now, she is leaving.
0	2	No one suspects that Britain's new leadership whoever it is will take a soft line toward Iraq.
0	2	Yet, if the going gets tough, it might have been comforting for Bush to be able to hear the tough old line from Thatcher.
0.484848484848485	3	Former President Reagan thanked British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher for backing him up when other allies backed down, heaping praise on his political soulmate as she heads off into the sunset.
0.285714285714286	3	Margaret Thatcher was a completely reliable ally and partner of the greatest personal integrity, Reagan said in a statement after Mrs. Thatcher announced her impending retirement.
0	3	I could always count on her wise counsel, her firm support, and her loyal friendship, Reagan said.
0.545454545454545	3	Mrs. Thatcher on Thursday succumbed to the challenge mounted by Michael Heseltine, who resigned as her defense minister in 1986.
0.32	3	Reagan and the prime minister dubbed the Iron Lady formed a formidable duo in the 1980s and made no secret of their mutual regard.
0	3	They often stood side-by-side at international gatherings and called each other Ronnie and Margaret.
0.0930232558139535	3	Two years ago, as they met for the final time before Reagan left office, the president said he was leaving the White House with considerable satisfaction in the knowledge that Margaret Thatcher will still reside at No. 10 Downing Street.
0	3	Reagan, who spent Thanksgiving with friends at his Bel-Air home, called her resignation in the face of strong opposition a selfless and courageous decision in what she believes is the best interests of her country.
0.32	3	The former chief executive was always grateful to Mrs. Thatcher's support of his conservative approach to foreign affairs during his own eight-year tenure.
0.117647058823529	3	In 1986, when the U.S. bombing of Libya was criticized by world powers, Mrs. Thatcher was the only ally who supported Reagan and allowed the bombers to fly from British bases.
0	3	When Britain fought Argentina for the Falkland Islands, the United States was forced to choose between two allies.
0.666666666666667	3	Reagan sided with Mrs. Thatcher.
0	3	She also encouraged Reagan's nurturing of the huge Pentagon buildup, and backed U.S. efforts to install medium-range missiles in Europe, despite opposition from NATO allies.
0	3	Both leaders adopted a hard line toward the Soviet Union, but were quick to warm up to Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev as the Cold War thawed.
0.333333333333333	3	Reagan credited Mrs. Thatcher's resoluteness for playing a key role in ending the tensions between the Western democracies and the Eastern Block.
0	3	She stood up to the Soviets and let them know she meant business, he said.
0	3	Both were ardent advocates of the free market and private enterprise.
0.4	3	While the United States became mired in debt in the era of Reaganomics, the British economy thrived on Mrs. Thatcher's radical policies during her nearly 12-year rule.
0	3	Average earnings were up by nearly one-third and more Britons owned their homes during her tenor.
0.129032258064516	3	Like Reagan, however, Mrs. Thatcher was accused by liberals of widening the gap between the rich and poor in her country, and both clashed with organized labor.
0.142857142857143	4	Margaret Thatcher set the example of what a woman could achieve in British society, but her critics say she did little else to help women along.
0	4	For some, it was enough that her political career reached the heights.
0.41025641025641	4	One woman wrote to The Independent newspaper last week that her 7-year-old daughter wondered what title Mrs. Thatcher's successor would hold, since he couldn't be called prime minister, that's a girl's name.
0.333333333333333	4	Emma Nicholson, a Conservative Party lawmaker, said it was once unthinkable that a woman would ever be a British prime minister.
0	4	She has broken the mold once and forever, Ms. Nicholson said in an interview.
0.48	4	Mrs. Thatcher, who trained as a chemist before studying law, said she viewed herself as prime minister, not as a woman.
0	4	She believed the battle for women's rights had been largely won and was no believer in feminism.
0	4	What has it ever done for me?
0	4	she once asked.
0.296296296296296	4	Mrs. Thatcher, who stepped down on Thursday, urged women to get involved in politics, but did little to pull them up the ladder.
0	4	Several female lawmakers were appointed to junior executive posts in various ministries, but the only woman to serve in a Thatcher Cabinet was Baroness Young, leader of the House of Lords from 1981 to 1983.
0.121212121212121	4	The truth is that although Mrs. Thatcher is a woman, she doesn't believe in the advancement of women, Clare Short, a Labor Party lawmaker, said last month.
0.461538461538462	4	Edwina Currie, a former junior health minister, said any other prime minister would have had several women in and out of the Cabinet.
0	4	It's Margaret's fault that the only people standing wear trousers, Mrs. Currie said last week.
0.32	4	Trree men are vying to succeed her as Conservative Party leader and thus prime minister in a vote by party lawmakers set for Tuesday.
0	4	Traditional male attitudes remain strong in Britain, from the upper-crust, all-male clubs of London to the topless women pictured daily in the tabloid press.
0	4	Women are paid less than men and are poorly represented in management jobs and in Parliament.
0	4	However, campaigners for women rights say there are encouraging signs at the grassroots.
0	4	The critical mass of women have entered middle management in government and business, said Lesley Abdela, a founding member of the 300 Group.
0	4	The group seeks equal representation for women in the 650-seat House of Commons, which now has 43 female members.
0.32	4	Women represented 43 percent of the British labor force in 1988, compared with 40 percent in 1979 when Mrs. Thatcher became prime minister.
0	4	Britain has a higher proportion of working women than other European Community countries.
0.0952380952380952	4	Though Mrs. Thatcher never made a priority of women's issues, she did introduce some helpful legislation: tax concessions for workplace nurseries; independent taxation for married women; and legislation to compel absent fathers to pay child benefits.
0.4	4	But as prime minister, she angered feminists by often emphasizing women's traditional roles of homemakers and care-givers.
0.428571428571429	4	Angela Rumbold, the Conservative Party's minister for women's issues, contends that an enormous amount has been done for women during the Thatcher years.
0	4	I'm not sure what she could have gone beyond promoting people who were there just because they were women, she said in an interview.
0.571428571428571	4	Margaret Thatcher is a great meritocrat.
0	4	She believes in getting people to succeed on their merits.
0.2	4	Jo Hawkins of the 300 Group, which is seeking equal numbers of women in the House of Commons, believes Mrs. Thatcher's extraordinary abilities made it difficult for her to understand the needs of the average woman.
0	4	She would say that anybody can do it, just stick to your principles and get up and do it, Ms. Hawkins said.
0	4	I think because of her character, her personality and her amazing self-confidence, she isn't aware of how the normal person struggles.
0.342857142857143	5	Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher today argued passionately during a four-hour meeting that covered subjects ranging from disarmament to reports of Soviet bomber sales to Libya, officials said.
0	5	Reopening a European peace offensive that was disrupted by the Armenian earthquake, Gorbachev had frank exchanges, animated, warm, passionate and solemn," said a Thatcher spokesman, requesting anonymity.
0	5	Gorbachev also hit the streets of London, stopping his motorcade to shake hands with about 20 people in a crowd of several hundred who cheered him outside Westminster Abbey.
0.25	5	The Thatcher spokesman said the Soviet leader and the staunchly anti-Communist prime minister arguing."
0	5	Emerging from her 10 Downing St. residence into the icy rain with Gorbachev at her side, Thatcher told reporters:
0	5	talks have been very deep, very wide ranging and very friendly, and as always we got to grips with the real issues."
0	5	The spokesman said Thatcher asked Gorbachev about a report from Washington that Moscow sold up to 15 long-range fighter-bombers to Libya, which Britain accuses of sponsoring terrorism.
0	5	Gorbachev did not respond, he said.
0.114285714285714	5	Although the two leaders could make no progress on the bomber issue, the spokesman said the Soviet and British foreign ministers, meeting separately, would most likely discuss the matter at length.
0	5	He said Thatcher also accused the Soviets of having been as frank as they should be" about their chemical weapons arsenal.
0	5	He quoted Gorbachev as replying: you aren't fully satisfied, then quite clearly we have to have more exchanges.
0	5	We have got to try better to convince each other."
0	5	Another area of disagreement was Gorbachev's goal of eliminating all nuclear weapons from Europe.
0	5	Thatcher believes the deterrence of nuclear weapons prevents war.
0.740740740740741	6	Flamboyant former Defense Minister Michael Heseltine's challenge to Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher for leadership of the Conservative Party has caused a political sensation in Britain.
0.226415094339623	6	A crucial first vote of Tory Members of Parliament is scheduled for today, and if Heseltine should wrest control of the party from Thatcher the longest-serving British head of government in modern times she would also have to give up the prime minister's job that she has held since 1979.
0	6	Here's a sampling of editorial comment on the contest that has stirred Britain:
0	6	Thatcher era in British politics is almost over. It is more likely than not that she is finished altogether.
0	6	The coup de grace may not be delivered at this moment.
0	6	The nature of the era that comes afterward is far from clear.
0	6	But as a political force, she is condemned at best to an unrelenting rear-guard action which will end sometime in a humiliating abyss.
0	6	party may sullenly support her now, but they will ask the question again in the spring, knowing that if they do not do so the country will ask the same question even more pitilessly when the general election comes.
0	6	alternative, however, stares her in the face. It is to acknowledge that an era has passed, and preserve its achievements by standing down, releasing her lieutenants and urging her party, in the interests of a vanished unity, to support Mr. Hurd."
0	6	Thatcher biographer Hugo Young in The Guardian
0	6	contest for the leadership of the Conservative party should not be occurring.
0.114285714285714	6	would be foolish to deny that, today, the prime minister is politically beleaguered as never before. But the task of the Conservative party, in the year and more that remains before the next general election, must be to rally to enable Mrs. Thatcher to rebuild her personal position, and give her the confidence and support to win the fourth term she deserves."
0	6	The Daily Telegraph
0.19047619047619	6	could have guessed from watching the prime minister answer questions in the Commons that she was fighting for her life?
0	6	She was as brisk and well-briefed as ever.
0.8	6	Margaret Thatcher may be.
0	6	Bowed she most certainly is not."
0.0754716981132075	6	Conservative MPs must be prepared to reject Mrs. Thatcher when they vote in the party's leadership election. It is no longer in the interests of the United Kingdom, which are now inextricably linked with the development of a strong and united Europe, for her to remain in office.
0	6	European derives no satisfaction from reaching this conclusion.
0.228571428571429	6	Apart from her domestic achievements in reviving the British economy in the 1980s, Mrs. Thatcher has contributed much more to the development of the European Community than she is often given credit for.
0	6	The European believes that her nightmare vision of Europe, of ill-intentioned people trying to destroy democracy, is not shared by most of the British people.
0	6	They reject her view that pooling of sovereignty is no different from surrender.
0.571428571428571	6	Conservative Party faces a stark choice.
0.16	6	Either it will reelect Mrs. Thatcher and see the United Kingdom slip into isolation as it is left behind the rest of the Community.
0	6	Or it can choose a new leader who is prepared to participate genuinely in the argument about economic and political union."
0.32	6	prime minister in total command for 11 years could not be unseated, and cherished policies abandoned, without an explosion within the party.
0	6	It would take a Solomon to heal the divisions and prevent civil war.
0	6	Frankly, we cannot see Mr. Heseltine in that role.
0.0975609756097561	6	Sun also deeply questions his ability to be a successful or even adequate prime minister. This is the man who for the past five years has professed loyalty to the government and yet has been its most divisive force.
0	6	We discern just one constant loyalty and that is to Michael Heseltine."
0	6	Thatcher deserves better than to be dismissed in the shoddy and demeaning manner some Tory MPs are minded to have in store for her.
0	6	To be defeated by the people in a general election, as was Winston Churchill in 1945, that was an honorable rejection.
0	6	To be brought down by a vote of censure in the House of Commons, as was Neville Chamberlain in 1940 even that was a constitutionally respectable form of political demise.
0.615384615384615	6	But what they are proposing to do to Mrs. Thatcher, unquestionably the greatest peacetime prime minister of this century, is quite simply unworthy.
0	6	Her fate could be sealed, if her opponents have their way, behind closed doors in smoke-filled rooms. Persons of quality were always accorded the dignity of execution by ax or firing squad, rather than the humiliation of hanging.
0.16	6	These plotters would like to dispatch Mrs. Thatcher, who almost single-handedly has won three elections, by the political equivalent of the rope.
0	6	can find Heseltines wherever you go.
0.5	6	But there is only one Mrs. Thatcher.
0	6	Handle with care.
0	6	This valuable object is irreplaceable."
0	6	The Sunday Telegraph
0.148148148148148	6	newspaper has long maintained that the best result in the next general election would be for Margaret Thatcher to lead the Tories to a fourth victory.
0	6	Sadly, the course of events has conspired to make that unlikely.
0.166666666666667	6	British have never liked Margaret Thatcher; but as long as she delivered the goods they respected her, and voted for her.
0	6	When her government fails that lack of affection turns to growing resentment.
0.142857142857143	6	For reasons that are probably unfair and undeserved, Mrs. Thatcher is now a victim of that strongest public mood of all: time for a change.
0.181818181818182	6	Thatcher is right to feel bitter that a prime minister with her track record and prestige can be so easily challenged.
0	6	If she goes, the manner of her ousting will leave much to be desired; no other party could so lightly dispose of its leader in government, this side of an election, largely for reasons of unpopularity.
0	6	But the Tories have a nose for survival in power unmatched by any other party in the democratic world, and politics is an unforgiving business.
0.19047619047619	6	The issue before Tory MPs is not the reelection of Margaret Thatcher, it is the defeat of Neil Kinnock.
0.222222222222222	6	That requires saying a reluctant goodby to Mrs. Thatcher, and the endorsement of Michael Heseltine."
0	6	The Sunday Times
0.545454545454545	7	Embattled Margaret Thatcher remains leader of Britain's Conservative Party, and so the country's prime minister but only barely.
0.266666666666667	7	She has survived a vote of confidence taken by her party colleagues in the House of Commons, winning 204 votes against 152 for former defense minister Michael Heseltine.
0	7	But under Tory party rules, that margin, representing something less than a ringing endorsement, forces Thatcher to face a second round of voting on Tuesday.
0	7	Other candidates could choose to stand against her, perhaps diluting the opposition vote and letting her claim the simple majority she needs to stay as party head.
0	7	But her reelection is hardly assured.
0	7	Polls show the Tories would do better in the next national elections with someone other than Thatcher leading them.
0.19047619047619	7	But elections don't have to be called until mid-1992; Thatcher's public standing could conceivably increase by then.
1	7	Thatcher has served as PM longer than anyone in this century.
0	7	She led her party to victory in three elections, steered it through the war with Argentina to reclaim the Falklands, faced down the miners union in a long strike, moved often drastically to reverse Britain's economic decline and won a prominent place on the world stage.
0	7	But 11 1/2 years in office is a long time.
0	7	Memory and feelings being what they are, it is the mistakes and irritations of this long tenure that are more likely to be immediately recalled, while its achievements are left to history to salute.
0	7	Thatcher is seen as having become increasingly autocratic at home and a somewhat tiresome scold within the European Community.
0	7	Her government is deeply identified with high interest rates, inflation and a flat tax on every adult that is generally regarded as hugely unfair.
0	7	Ultimately, in the cold calculus of politics, the question that will most decisively sway Conservative MPs is whether they are more likely to win the next election with Thatcher at their head or someone else.
0	7	Next week will bring the answer.
0.235294117647059	8	President Bush lost an irreplaceable pin supporting his mission in the Persian Gulf on Thanksgiving Day.
0.307692307692308	8	He heard the news of Margaret Thatcher's resignation as he celebrated the holiday in the Saudi desert and it clearly came as a shock.
0	8	In the State Department, too, it came as a shock.
0.181818181818182	8	Americans who had come to take Thatcher for granted during her 11 years of power were not prepared for her passing.
0	8	Thatcher had told the world that she would fight to a second ballot after her narrow failure to retain the premiership outright on Tuesday.
0	8	The feeling everywhere was that Thatcher always stuck to her word.
0	8	So no problem.
0	8	Pass the turkey.
0.195121951219512	8	Thatcher's friends all over the world had reckoned without the British Conservative Party, which had looked at the opinion polls, the bad economic news and an unpopular new tax and smelled a loss at the next election.
0	8	They had reckoned without the hatred for the flamboyant Michael Heseltine among the middle-ranking party figures who risked losing their jobs and future prospects if the unpredictable came to power.
0.0701754385964912	8	It was an extraordinary scene in the palace of Westminster on Wednesday night as one by one her own Cabinet members trooped sheepishly into Thatcher's office and told her, in their chosen code, that they support her over the weekend" in the second round of secret balloting on the party's leadership.
0	8	Therefore, if Heseltine was to be beaten, it had to be by someone else.
0	8	After on it," as one of her closest advisers put it, Thatcher reluctantly concluded that she had to go.
0.324324324324324	8	Thus did the toughest fighter for shared British and American values since Winston Churchill become the first prime minister to be forced out of office by the Conservative Party since the failed war leader Neville Chamberlain.
0	8	When George Bush recovered from his Thanksgiving surprise, he was generous in his praise.
0	8	Two years ago, his words would have rung hollow.
0	8	The President began his term in office without much trust in her.
0	8	He had seen the influence she exerted over Ronald Reagan and was keen to be seen as his own man.
0	8	He had heard her doubts over the pace of German reunification and the integration of Europe, and had been persuaded by his advisers that she stood against the United States' best interests.
0	8	Gradually, however, that changed.
0.235294117647059	8	At the beginning of the Persian Gulf crisis, the President deliberately sought Thatcher's analysis.
0	8	It was her assessment of the threat to international security posed by Iraqi aggression that, according to British and American sources, set the moral framework for Operation Desert Shield.
0	8	The pivotal moment was when she fielded press questions about Iraq on Bush's behalf in the Colorado mountain garden of the U.S. ambassador to Britain, Henry Catto; that marked the public turning point.
0	8	She was able to articulate what Bush sensed was right.
0	8	And he was able to defer to her without embarrassment, seeming almost gentlemanly in allowing her to go first.
0	8	Bush is unlikely to reach such a rapport with any of her three potential successors.
0	8	Heseltine is an exceptionally powerful orator, but it hard to see that helping the tongue-tied American President.
0	8	Douglas Hurd, the urbane foreign secretary, is an English James Baker; the President already has a James Baker.
0.153846153846154	8	John Major, the chancellor of the Exchequer and Thatcher's own choice to succeed her, may have views very close to Bush's.
0	8	But he is mild-mannered, slightly clumsy and, although widely liked and admired by his friends, is almost wholly without international experience.
0	8	The issue is no longer the Anglo-American relationship."
0.19047619047619	8	It is Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan who will go down in history as Washington and London's romantics."
0	8	They were the ones who would each ditch their closest friends in order to support the other: Reagan when overruling Jeane Kirkpatrick's objections to the Falklands campaign, and Thatcher when blocking her own right wing's protests at the U.S. bombing of Libya from British bases.
0	8	They shared the conviction that communism could be rolled back and she helped persuade him that Mikhail Gorbachev was a man who could be trusted.
0	8	The powerful enunciation of that belief and its eventual vindication may be the last great achievement of the special postwar Anglo-American alliance.
0.166666666666667	8	George Bush and Margaret Thatcher had something more simple in common, a pragmatic relationship of mutual respect and support that benefited both.
0.285714285714286	8	British policy toward Iraq will not change suddenly under a new prime minister.
0.222222222222222	8	The doubling of the size of the British gulf force on Thursday attempted emphatically to prove that.
0.19047619047619	8	But as time goes by, Britain's allies will find that many certainties have passed along with Margaret Thatcher.
0	8	If seductive deals emerge to save the face and the atomic-weapon factories of Saddam Hussein, her steadfastness will be sorely missed.
0.129032258064516	8	And if Europe becomes more inward-looking and protectionist, blame those who booted out the prime minister whose final words to her Cabinet were, a funny old world."
0	8	Her memoirs deserve a more dignified title.
0.413793103448276	9	Queen Elizabeth II awarded former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher the coveted Order of Merit on Friday and made her husband a baronet, which is a hereditary knighthood.
0	9	From now on Denis Thatcher will be formally addressed as Sir Denis and his wife as Lady Thatcher, although she insisted Friday she wished to be known simply as Thatcher."
0.75	9	have done pretty well out of being Mrs. Thatcher," said the former prime minister, who resigned Nov. 22 during a fight for the leadership of the Conservative Party.
0	9	Palace insiders said Friday that one reason for the quick award of the Order of Merit, restricted to only 24 eminent men and women, was the queen's desire to demonstrate that there is no animosity between Britain's two most prominent women.
0	9	In the past, Buckingham Palace sources and journalists assigned to the royal court have said that the two did not get along.
0.125	9	puts rumors that the queen and Mrs. Thatcher didn't like each other," said Harold Brooks-Baker, director of Burke's Peerage and an authority on the royal family.
0	9	As a member of the Order of Merit, created in 1902, Thatcher joins such luminaries in the world of arts, science and politics as philosopher Isiah Berlin, historian Veronica Wedgwood, writer Graham Greene, violinist Yehudi Menuhin and artist Sidney Noland, as well as honorary member Mother Teresa.
0.19047619047619	9	Deceased recipients include Prime Minister Winston Churchill, Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower, missionary Albert Schweitzer and actor Lawrence Olivier.
0	9	Contrary to some reports, the OM, as it is popularly called, does not precede all other British royal honors but ranks behind the Order of the Garter, which dates from 1348.
0	9	Thatcher said she was honored and moved" by the award.
0.19047619047619	9	At the same time, the queen gave a baronetcy to Thatcher's husband Denis, the subject of fictional letters from No. 10 Downing Street invented by the satirical magazine Private Eye about life as the prime minister's consort.
0	9	Baronets date from 1611.
0.121212121212121	9	Sir Denis' title passes upon his death to his son, Mark, who is married to an American, and will eventually pass to Mark Thatcher's son, Michael.
0	9	With an OM, Thatcher can continue to serve in the House of Commons as the member from the North London constituency of Finchley.
0	9	Burke's Brooks-Baker believes that Thatcher eventually should be made a hereditary countess, which in Britain is the female equivalent of an earl.
0.266666666666667	9	Traditionally, retiring prime ministers of Britain were granted earldoms, although Churchill, for one, refused a peerage, preferring to remain in the House of Commons.

0.0976190476190476	1	At City Hall in San Francisco a radio reporter told listeners, The entire building started to shake you could hear people yelling and screaming all over the building.
0	1	She said there were obvious problems at the health department across the street.
0	1	Water was literally gushing out of the building from a window on the second floor, the unidentified reporter said.
0.112637362637363	1	Citizens of Marin, north of San Francisco, were warned to shut off their gas because the smell of gas was all over town.

0.418367346938775	1	The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on seismographs.
0	1	Every increase of one number means a tenfold increase in magnitude.
0	1	Thus a reading of 7.5 reflects an earthquake 10 times stronger than one of 6.5.
0.244047619047619	1	An earthquake of 6 on the scale can cause severe damage.
0.209183673469388	1	A 7 reading is a major earthquake, capable of widespread heavy damage.
0.675824175824176	1	The San Francisco earthquake of 1906, which occurred before the Richter scale was devised, has been estimated at 8.3 on the Richter scale.
0.39047619047619	2	The major earthquake that struck the San Francisco Bay area Tuesday occurred in a region seismologists targeted as having the highest probability of a strong quake in Northern California.
0.33469387755102	2	A 1988 report by the U.S. Geological Survey placed the probability of an earthquake of 6.5 magnitude on the Richter scale at 30 percent by the year 2018 in the Southern Santa Cruz mountains.
0.0697278911564626	2	The high probability is based on several factors, including length of time since the last major earthquake struck the area in 1906, said Clarence Allen, professor of Geology and Geophysics at the California Institue of Technology in Pasadena.
0.292857142857143	2	This is not to say we predicted the earthquake.
0	2	It just has to do with the probability of an earthquake in this area, Allen said.
0.188940092165899	2	He noted that the 1988 report, titled Probabilities of Large Earthquakes Occurring in California on the San Andreas Fault, presented information that was already widely known among scientists.
0	2	Allen said this information should have alerted officials to take preventive steps.
0.697278911564626	2	Frank Baldwin of U.S. Geological Survey's Earthquake Center said the quake's magnitude was 6.9 on the Richter scale.
0	2	It was centered in the Santa Cruz, Calif., area, 75 miles south of San Francico.
0.418367346938775	2	The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on seismographs.
0.325396825396825	2	A reading of 6 can cause severe damage.
0.172268907563025	2	A quake of 7 magnitude, a major earthquake, is capable of widespread heavy damage.
0.650793650793651	2	Initial reports indicated widespread damage from Tuesday's quake, especially affecting highways and old masonry buildings.
0	2	It's not like an earthquake of this size in this area is a calamitous event.
0	2	It's something we should therefore be ready for, Allen said.
0.406746031746032	2	The damage in the Bay area occurred to the same kind of structures heavily damaged in the 1987 Whittier quake in the Los Angeles area, which registered a 5.9 Richter reading, Allen said.
0	2	I think we'll learn a lot from an engineering point of view from this earthquake, he said.
0	2	What will be important is to see how the modern structures behaved.
0.325396825396825	2	Allen said many of the same kinds of older structures that appeared to have been damaged in San Francisco also exist in the Los Angeles region.
0.366071428571429	2	In addition, some of the roadways and overpasses in the area have roughly the same kind of construction as the Bay Bridge.
0	2	In some areas of Southern California, there is a higher probability of a major quake occurring.
0	2	The highest, the USGS says, is in the central California town of Parkfield, where there is a 90 percent probability of a magnitude 6 earthquake by the year 2018.
0.488095238095238	3	Ever since the 1906 earthquake devastated San Francisco, many scientists have believed the next big one would strike the Los Angeles end of the mighty San Andreas Fault.
0.600732600732601	3	But studies in recent years have reminded the Bay Area that it also faced another seismic disaster, and those studies became a reality Tuesday when a quake measuring 6.9 on the Richter scale rocked the Bay area.
0.0665584415584416	3	A 1985 paper in the Geophysical Research Letters predicted a 6.9-magnitude quake could happen any time on a portion of the San Andreas Fault that stretches 50 miles from Palo Alto southward through the Santa Cruz Mountains and on to San Juan Bautista.
0.183035714285714	3	The quake was centered on the San Andreas segment described in the article, but Tom Heaton, the scientist in charge of the U.S. Geological Survey office in Pasadena, said it wasn't clear yet whether it broke all or part of the 50-mile segment.
0.27891156462585	3	The epicenter of the quake was about 8 miles northeast of Santa Cruz and 75 miles south of San Francisco.
0.0915178571428571	3	The 1985 study, by Columbia University geology professor Christopher Scholz, was among several that produced conflicting estimates on the likelihood and size of the quake that finally happened Tuesday.
0.158301158301158	3	These studies gave various interpretations of how much stress inside the Earth was released by the great San Francisco earthquake of 1906, which had a magnitude of about 8.3 and killed at least 2,500 people.
0.112637362637363	3	The bigger a quake, the more stress it relieves, and thus the longer it takes for the same size quake to happen again.
0.12202380952381	3	Scholz pointed to evidence that the 1906 quake didn't relieve as much stress in the Santa Cruz Mountains as other scientists believed.
0.650793650793651	3	That suggested a bigger quake might happen in the San Francisco Bay area sooner than some believed.
0.127329192546584	3	Faced with conflicting estimates, the Geological Survey issued a July 1988 report that it said represented a consensus on the debate.
0.585714285714286	3	The report said the 50-mile segment had a 20 percent likelihood of producing a magnitude-7 quake within 30 years.
0.488095238095238	3	It said the southernmost 20 miles of that segment had a 30 percent chance of generating a magnitude-6.5 quake within 30 years.
0.195238095238095	3	Tuesday's jolt was centered within those southernmost 20 miles of the fault segment.
0	3	Clearly, scientists had identified this segment as a particularly hazardous one, Heaton said.
0	3	There was some debate about the length of the rupture and the size of the earthquake.
0.254658385093168	3	The last great southern California quake, in 1857, killed very few people in a region that was then sparsely populated.
0.188940092165899	3	Thus most assumed that Los Angeles, not the Bay Area, would fall victim to the next seismic catastrophe; the 1988 USGS report cast doubt on this assumption.
0.462406015037594	3	Federal emergency officials have estimated that the next big one a quake like the 1906 San Francisco quake could kill 3,000 to 14,000 people in southern California, and 3,000 to 11,000 people in the Bay Area.
0.266233766233766	3	As bad as Tuesday's quake was, it was not a 1906 earthquake, Geological Survey director Dalas Peck said.
0	3	The question is not whether a big earthquake is coming.
0	3	The question is when, Peck said.
0.3003663003663	4	Private groups and officials from Tokyo to London to Charleston, S.C., offered help to the ruptured San Francisco Bay area, but some said relief for the earthquake could drain coffers already strained by previous disasters.
0.33469387755102	4	Los Angeles, long San Francisco's West Coast competitor but equally at the mercy of the San Andreas Fault, quickly shipped doctors, sonic equipment and fire investigators to the Bay Area.
0.0813492063492063	4	The mayor of a sister city in disaster, Charleston's Joseph P. Riley Jr., sent a plane load of drinking water, a symbolic return of the support his city got after Hugo.
0	4	I know we still have and will have great needs here and charity certainly begins at home, Riley said.
0	4	However, it would be wrong for this community not to reach in and contribute to those who are hurt and suffering right now.
0.549107142857143	4	San Francisco Mayor Art Agnos has estimated damage $2 billion in his city alone.
0	4	The Salvation Army had the food cooking almost before the earth quit shaking in Northern California, while the Red Cross opened the doors and unfolded cots in 25 shelters.
0	4	We don't wait for anybody, said Col. Leon Ferraez, communications director of the Salvation Army.
0	4	We're there the minute the news is on.
0	4	According to Ferraez, the organization dispatched 12 mobile canteens to the hardest-hit earthquake areas within minutes.
0.100985221674877	4	All Salvation Army centers in the Bay Area, including 34 community service centers and scores of other units, have been turned over to the relief effort.
0.195238095238095	4	Los Angeles donated sonic equipment to help detect sounds of people trapped in rubble.
0	4	And officials in Los Alamos, N.M., dispatched a device used to locate survivors of last year's Armenian quake.
0	4	Israel offered the services of a special army rescue squad that also helped dig out victims in Armenia.
0	4	A French disaster relief agency offered to send special teams of searchers.
0.418367346938775	4	A team of British engineers were to fly to San Francisco today to help assess structural damage from the quake.
0.216931216931217	4	The Bay Area has a large Asian population, and callers from Japan and the Philippines and other countries jammed phone lines trying to reach relatives.
0.127329192546584	4	The Osaka, Japan, city government announced it was sending $10,000 to San Francisco, a sister city since 1957.
0.354978354978355	4	Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley sent police and fire investigators to assess damage from the quake, and convened his own emergency council in a special meeting to discuss other possible measures.
0.133116883116883	4	I am joining millions of Californians as we intensely watch the damage of the large San Francisco earthquake, said Bradley.
0.610119047619048	4	We all know the horrors of an earthquake and we express our deep-felt sympathy for the people of the San Francisco Bay area.
0.0791505791505791	4	An Anheuser-Busch Inc. brewery in Fairfield, 35 miles northeast of San Francisco, interrupted normal operations to fill cans with drinking water instead of beer for free shipment to relief agencies, the company said.
0.104591836734694	4	Coast Guard offices across the West Coast provided San Francisco with as many boats and helicopters as could be spared, said Coast Guard spokeswoman Elizabeth Neely.
0.285714285714286	4	The Red Cross sent 290 units of blood from Los Angeles; the San Diego Blood Bank rushed 50 units to San Francisco within an hour of the quake; more than 400 units were sent from Portland, Ore.
0	4	Giving makes them feel good, said Trudy Sullivan, a Red Cross spokeswoman in Portland.
0	4	Even the Internal Revenue Service got into the act, announcing it would waive penalties for taxpayers unable to file returns or make scheduled payments because of the earthquake.
0.891304347826087	4	President Bush directed $273 million in immediate aid for quake victims and said he would visit the area Friday or Saturday.
0.0887445887445887	4	But some officials said the disaster could strain the coffers of private agencies and those of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which was criticized for its response to the storm-lashed Carolinas.
0.112637362637363	4	The Red Cross began its fiscal year July 1 with $18.5 million in its disaster budget, and had spent 40 percent by September.
0	4	Then Hugo came along, triggering an effort the agency estimates will cost $42 million the most ever.
0	4	When a major earthquake and a major hurricane hit back-to-back, you can bet it will stretch Red Cross disaster resources and manpower, said Bob Vessey, director of disaster services in Washington, D.C.
0.55256064690027	5	Tuesday's earthquake, the strongest on the San Andreas fault since the San Francisco quake on April 18, 1906, came in a place that had been identified by scientists just last year as the most likely spot for a major jolt in Northern California within the next 30 years.
0.124620060790274	5	The epicenter of the temblor, eight miles east-northeast of the city of Santa Cruz in the Santa Cruz Mountains, was at virtually the same spot as earthquakes in the 5-magnitude range that occurred on June 27, 1988, and Aug. 8, 1989.
0	5	A 6.5-magnitude quake was centered there in 1865.
0.154135338345865	5	The U.S. Geological Survey, in a 1988 report on regions of high earthquake probability in California, said there was a 30% chance of another 6.5-magnitude earthquake in the immediate vicinity by the year 2018.
0.141705069124424	5	The report cited even higher probabilities for major temblors on the San Andreas near Parkfield in central California and Coachella in Southern California in the same period, but it pinpointed the Santa Cruz mountains as the most vulnerable spot in Northern California, in part because the area marked the southernmost point of maximum ground slippage during the 1906 earthquake.
0.0636645962732919	5	A period of 83 years is short as far as earthquake intervals go, and during this time, scientists said Tuesday night, pressure was probably building up in the southern neighboring segment of the San Andreas, which had not slipped as much.
0.162698412698413	5	Thomas Heaton, the Geological Survey scientist in charge of the agency's Pasadena field office, said that the 1987 and 1988 earthquakes now must be seen as of the Tuesday's 6.9 temblor.
0	5	He said would not be the proper term, since months had elapsed before the more powerful earthquake struck.
0	5	Heaton said that a still larger shock is unlikely.
0	5	But he joined Caltech scientists in saying that aftershocks as strong as 5.9 magnitude should be expected, and that the pattern of aftershocks could last for months.
0.650793650793651	5	A 5.9 aftershock would be as strong as the 1987 Whittier quake in the Los Angeles area.
0.0597667638483965	5	After both the 1987 and the 1988 earthquakes in the Santa Cruz mountains, the state Office of Emergency Services and the U.S. Geological Survey issued warnings of increased risk of sizable shakes, ranging up to 6.5 magnitude, within the next few days in the vicinity.
0	5	But these warnings said that if nothing happened, then the chances of a major earthquake would recede to normal for the vicinity.
0.313775510204082	5	The trouble was, the area was more prone to quakes at this time than any other place in the Bay Area on the San Andreas Fault.
0.146428571428571	5	Only the nearby Hayward fault may harbor as great a danger of a catastrophic earthquake in the Bay Area.
0.117142857142857	5	The San Andreas, the longest and best-known earthquake fault in California, extends from Point Arena in Mendocino County to the Salton Sea.
0	5	It has been the site of the deadliest and most destructive earthquakes in the state's recorded history.
0.0437100213219616	5	Although Tuesday's quake was powerful, Waverly Person, chief of the National Earthquake Information Service in Golden, Colo., cautioned that at 6.9 magnitude, it should be considered only a shock, not a one, as a quake in the 7.0 to 7.9 range would be classified, or a one, as a quake of 8.0 or above would be.
0.162698412698413	5	Person and others in the Geological Survey warned Tuesday night that the probability is 40% that a temblor more powerful than Tuesday's will strike in Southern California sometime in the next three decades.
0.0915178571428571	5	But, as it was, Tuesday's quake was about four times stronger than the devastating Sylmar-San Fernando earthquake of 1971 and 10 times stronger than the 1987 Whittier quake.
0	5	Each point of magnitude represents a 10-fold increase in the power of an earthquake.
0.188940092165899	5	Person said that, like most San Andreas earthquakes, this was most likely to be a strike-slip quake, with one side of the fault grinding horizontally past another.
0.0944700460829493	5	But he said a final evaluation would have to await on-scene inspection teams that will be sent into the epicenter area today by the Geological Survey's Menlo Park office.
0.0697278911564626	5	Jim Dewey, a research geophysicist at the National Earthquake Center, said preliminary evaluations indicated that the fracture was about 10 miles deep, and that the quake rupture extended about 30 miles south down the fault from the epicenter.
0.0813492063492063	5	Person said that the area of strongest shaking was around Santa Cruz, although this evaluation too will have to await field evaluations, as will a final confirmation of the magnitude of the earthquake.
0.0480093676814988	5	The nearest metropolitan area to Tuesday's earthquake, San Jose, has seen nearly a dozen earthquakes of 5 magnitude or greater in the last 10 years, but several of them have been on the Calaveras fault, which generally runs just east of San Jose, more than 10 miles east of San Andreas at this point.
0.209183673469388	5	Scientists do not yet understand whether the quakes on the Calaveras fault may have been a precursor, or somehow added pressure, on the San Andreas.
0	5	But when a 5.1 earthquake did strike on the Calaveras in 1988, some earthquake scientists expressed concern that this could be the case.
0.139455782312925	5	Between the late 1950s and 1979, there were no quakes of magnitude 5 or larger near the Bay Area.
0	5	But in August, 1979, a 6.4-magnitude quake struck under Coyote Lake east of Gilroy and south of San Jose, and since then there have been a number of quakes.
0.27891156462585	5	In August, Geological Survey scientists had expressed concern at the step-up in 5-magnitude quakes south of the Bay Area.
0.462406015037594	5	They noted that a similar series of moderately strong quakes had preceded the San Francisco quake of 1906.
0.0597667638483965	5	Meanwhile, a New Mexico scientist who studies tidal forces, supported by two eyewitnesses, said Tuesday night that at a private lecture in San Francisco on Oct. 10, he had stated that a strong quake in the vicinity was probable on or about Oct. 16.
0	5	Iben Browning, of Sandia Park, N. M., said he had based his prediction on an assessment of tidal forces caused by the moon's relationship with the Earth.
0	5	He said he had decided to keep the assessment private because he feared that publicity about it would cause people to panic.

0	5	Damage to 3rd Avenue overpass in San Mateo.
0	5	Portions of Interstate 280 closed in Los Altos due to buckling.
0	5	Two killed at Santa Cruz shopping mall.
0	6	There are events one never forgets.
0	6	Anyone who was alive in 1963 remembers where he was when President Kennedy was assassinated.
0.439285714285714	6	And anyone who was at Candlestick Park Tuesday night for Game 3 of the World Series will never forget.
0	6	I was in a trailer just outside the stadium, about to watch the telecast when the earthquake hit.
0	6	It was shortly after the network went on the air.
0	6	My immediate reaction was that a jet was flying very low overhead, but soon I knew what was happening.
0	6	To me, the earthquake was not as bad as the Whittier quake in October, 1987, mainly because I was awake this time.
0	6	I opened the door to the trailer and looked out.
0.0887445887445887	6	The stadium was shaking and the special concrete joint one of several strategically spaced around the top of the stadium to prevent earthquake damage was doing was it was designed to do.
0	6	It was opening and closing as if the place was made of cardboard instead of concrete.
0.104591836734694	6	A few people were running out of the stadium, but there did not seem to be great alarm, because the quake did not last long.
0	6	I walked into the stadium to interview fans.
0	6	And again, I sensed little panic.
0.34453781512605	6	Most people stayed in their seats, waiting to hear whether the game would be postponed.
0	6	And later, when fans started leaving en masse, the reaction of those I talked to varied.
0.154135338345865	6	Those who were sitting in the upper deck seemed considerably more shaken than those in the lower levels.
0	7	On Telegraph Hill, Jerry Lubenow got his biggest shock when he arrived at his apartment after the deadly earthquake.
0	7	was no damage to our place or in our neighborhood," he said.
0	7	The only thing Lubenow could figure out was that Hill is on rock."
0.0976190476190476	7	He then talked to friends who live on Nob Hill and Russian Hill, which are also situated on rock, and learned that their residences also avoided damage.
0	7	almost feel guilty," he said, referring to his own good fortune.
0	7	like living through the blitz in London in the Second World War."
0.266233766233766	7	Only a few miles away in San Francisco's affluent Marina District, dozens of fashionable townhouses were damaged or destroyed.
0	7	Some buckled and pitched forward off their foundations into the street.
0	7	Others appeared outwardly sound but sustained interior damage that rendered them uninhabitable.
0.183035714285714	7	Why did some of the luxury, four-story apartment buildings collapse at the Marina while in nearby Chinatown, shops made of unreinforced masonry sustained little damage in the 6.9 temblor?
0.188940092165899	7	Why did high-rises that form the elegant San Francisco skyline escape virtually unscathed while an office building in the city's southeast district peel apart, killing five pedestrians below?
0.27891156462585	7	buildings that collapsed did so because of a combination of two things: very poor soil and very poor structural design," said Peter I. Yanev, chairman of EQE Engineering Inc., a structural engineering firm in San Francisco.
0	7	were on top of the worst soil conditions in the city," explained Yanev, who said he has traveled to the major earthquakes" in the last 20 years studying their impact on construction.
0.188940092165899	7	The soil beneath the Marina District, where six buildings burned down or collapsed, is made up of landfill partly dredged from the bay more than 70 years ago.
0.117142857142857	7	Yanev said many of the buildings in the neighborhood were erected in the early part of this century when there were no earthquake codes.
0.266233766233766	7	collapsed and killed some people were four-story apartment buildings that had garages built all the way along the bottom Yanev said.
0	7	you have a bunch of garages underneath all these apartments.
0	7	You effectively have no walls on one side of the building.
0	7	The connections just break, and the front end falls into the street."
0	7	Yanev called the two conditions a waiting to happen."
0.100985221674877	7	we have an earthquake centered off the Golden Gate Bridge instead of Santa Cruz, you'd probably have hundreds of these buildings collapse," he said.
0.308270676691729	7	Experts said they did not anticipate that the Marina District would be the major problem in an earthquake.
0	7	The worst areas, they believed, would be Chinatown and the Tenderloin, where brick buildings abound.
0	7	Chinatown survived relatively intact, Yanev said, because it is located in the hills" atop firm soil," and the epicenter of the temblor was many miles away.
0	7	In the city's high-rise office towers, a few broken windows and other cosmetic damage could be seen.
0.225274725274725	7	A preliminary survey found only three skyscrapers rendered unsafe by the quake.
0	7	But most buildings, including the landmark Transamerica Pyramid, were not touched.
0.104591836734694	7	Jay Cahill, an owner of Cahill Construction Co., a contractor that built several high-rises in the city, said the earthquake codes their job."
0.12202380952381	7	this quake proves is that the engineers were right" when they said tall buildings could withstand a strong quake, he said.
0.127329192546584	7	They said the downtown buildings are constructed to withstand a quake of at least 8 magnitude with an epicenter in San Francisco.
0.308270676691729	7	Earthquake experts said they were not surprised that the high-rises swayed with the earthquake while four-story buildings collapsed.
0	7	earthquake means that the ground shakes, and that means force is applied to the sides of buildings," said George C. Lee, acting director of the National Center for Earthquake Engineering Research at the University of Buffalo.
0	7	When architects design skyscrapers, Lee said, they factor in wind gusts and earth movement forces that are not considered as much when constructing smaller buildings.
0.108465608465608	7	In smaller buildings, he said, contractors usually make sure that vertical forces such as snow and ice cannot force a structure to collapse.
0.366071428571429	7	Throughout the Bay Area, residents were left to puzzle over why the earthquake savaged some buildings and bypassed others, much like San Francisco was left to wonder why the Marina District was hard hit and others spared.
0.100985221674877	7	In Santa Cruz, initial damages were estimated at $350 million, and 30% of the downtown mall the heart of the city was severely damaged.
0	7	An estimated 20 commercial buildings must be razed, a county official said.
0	7	In Los Gatos, 30 miles northeast of Santa Cruz, portions of the downtown area were destroyed.
0	7	Several dozen Victorian homes were shifted off their foundations, and numerous chimneys crumbled.
0.403940886699507	7	San Francisco fire officials said as many as 60 buildings in the Marina District may have to be torn down because of structural instability caused by the earthquake.
0	7	of the buildings are extremely hazardous," Assistant Fire Chief Frank Blackburn said.
0	7	are four-story buildings above garages.
0	7	All they had were vertical columns holding up the structures.
0	7	If you picture a building sitting on columns with no lateral support on those columns, when you get sideways motion, the buildings slide left and right."
0	7	Blackburn said many residents are not going to be able to get their belongings out.
0	7	a aftershock comes, it'll collapse," he said.
0.418367346938775	7	Buildings collapsed like cakes without yeast.
0	7	One fourth-floor apartment dweller stepped through her window onto the street after her building crumbled beneath her.

0.209183673469388	9	Although they are a continent apart, the cities of Charleston, S.C., and San Francisco now share a fateful page in the ledger of time.
0.244047619047619	9	They are the scenes of two of the century's costliest, back-to-back natural disasters: Hurricane Hugo and the Bay Area earthquake.
0	9	There are dramatic similarities and profound differences in the ways these two cities were affected and altered in the first week after they were ravaged by two powerful forces of nature one that angrily swept across the land from the sea and one that violently rumbled beneath the earth.
0.136212624584718	9	the standpoint of compassion, of all the people in America we can feel the hurt that the San Francisco area is going through the most," Charleston Mayor Joseph P. Riley Jr. said Sunday, one month after Hugo hit.
0	9	know it means, at best, the disruption of normal life for some time and, at worst, the loss of life."
0	9	Charleston had warning.
0.585714285714286	9	San Francisco did not.
0	9	Unlike earthquakes, hurricanes can be tracked by planes and radar, their paths predicted with sufficient certainty for those in harm's way to secure property and to flee.
0.104591836734694	9	Still, at least 28 deaths in the Carolinas are blamed on Hugo, while at least 60 deaths have been attributed to the Bay Area earthquake.
0.0813492063492063	9	Hugo, 500 miles across with winds topping 175 m.p.h., left virtually every street and every neighborhood littered with storm debris and 80% of the city's buildings with some degree of damage.
0	9	Five days after the storm, many city residents remained inconvenienced, most without electricity, many without safe drinking water.
0	9	Street lights didn't work.
0	9	Broken glass and other debris left the roadsides lined with cars stopped by flat tires.
0.162698412698413	9	By contrast the streets in most of San Francisco were passable within a day of the earthquake.
0	9	Electricity was largely restored overnight.
0	9	And most broken natural gas lines were quickly repaired.
0	9	Restaurants in Chinatown, North Beach and along Fillmore Street were crowded Saturday night.
0	9	Cable cars began carrying passengers Sunday and the curtain went up on the opera.
0	9	streets were immediately passable," said Charleston Police Chief Ruben Greenberg.
0	9	were gridlocked for two days because of the debris."
0.0976190476190476	9	And a week after the hurricane, Charleston which like San Francisco has a tourism-based economy was still trying to cope with mountains of broken trees and shattered roofs.
0	9	It was more than 10 days before restaurants and other stores began to slowly reopen and twice as long for night life to begin to return.
0	9	Tour Buses Return
0	9	By Sunday, tourists and tour buses could be seen outside hotels near Fisherman's Wharf and at other locations favored by visitors.
0.292857142857143	9	Tourism is a $2.5-billion-a-year business in San Francisco.
0	9	It took almost three weeks for businesses that cater to tourists to get back on their feet in Charleston.
0	9	It's likely to take a lot longer for the tourists themselves to return in numbers that made it one of the city's biggest industries.
0.557823129251701	9	Citywide, Charleston had 68 buildings collapse, compared to 60 buildings destroyed just in San Francisco's Marina District.
0	9	In Charleston most of the damage could be quickly assessed.
0	9	It was visible.
0.244047619047619	9	In San Francisco much of the damage may still be undetected.
0	9	Water mains and gas lines weakened by the heaving earth may not break for weeks or months.
0	9	Structural damage to houses, in many instances, will become apparent over a long period of time.
0	9	a hurricane is over, it's over," Greenberg said.
0	9	so with an earthquake.
0	9	You have aftershocks."
0.325396825396825	9	Charleston also escaped widespread damage to its infrastructure.
0.258403361344538	9	lost no major economic area like the Bay Bridge," said Greenberg, who was once San Francisco's undersheriff and who returned with emergency supplies to help the Santa Cruz police.
0	9	an economic lifeline.
0	9	All we lost was one minor bridge.
0	9	They're going to have humongous traffic problems."
0	9	Hugo left Charleston isolated from the world.
0.216931216931217	9	Communications broke down soon after the storm crossed the coastline about midnight and it was daybreak before the nation began to learn of the widespread damage.
0	9	Even local residents were left without any information.
0	9	The hurricane knocked out all local television and radio stations, and local officials for almost two days depended on a Florida radio station to deliver vital information and warnings.
0.117142857142857	9	Millions were watching the pregame World Series program when the earthquake struck, and instantly word was out that there had been a disaster.
0.183035714285714	9	San Francisco stations were able to broadcast to residents who had battery-powered radios and TVs.
0	9	Damage estimates from Hugo have ranged as high as $5 billion, while earthquake damage estimates Sunday reached the $6.6 billion mark.
0.0813492063492063	9	Besides that black page in the ledger of history, both San Francisco and Charleston also have another experience in common: Both have experienced frustrating delays in getting disaster relief from the federal government.
0	9	Greenberg, who has now watched the federal government respond to two of America's worst disasters, said he sees relatively few differences between how the Federal Emergency Management Agency worked in South Carolina and Northern California.
0	9	nothing that needs to be done in a hurry with them," he said.
0	9	just plop along like one of the horses at Disneyland.
0	9	Just plop, plop, plop.
0	9	They are repeating the mistakes of South Carolina in California."

0.385714285714286	0	Ben-Hur in 1959 was the most-awarded film with 11, and Walt Disney was the most-awarded person with 32.
0.192857142857143	1	What do Charlie Chaplin, Greta Garbo, Cary Grant, Alfred Hitchcock and Steven Spielberg have in common?
0	1	They have never won Academy Awards for their individual achievements.
0	1	Such flagrant omissions are often cited by critics as evidence of the unfairness of Hollywood's highest prize.
0.857142857142857	1	Oscar's 60-year history is filled with examples of the film world's highest achievers being overlooked by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.
0	1	The latest casualties are directors James L. Brooks, whose movie Broadcast News was nominated though he wasn't, and Spielberg who was left out in the cold with his Empire of the Sun.
0.142857142857143	1	Although Broadcast News won seven major nominations, including best picture and three acting categories, Brooks was strangely overlooked by the Academy's directing branch.
0.0918367346938776	1	Since no movie has ever won a best picture Oscar without its director at least being nominated, the chances of the once-favored Broadcast News to be a big winner at the awards ceremony on April 11 have been significantly reduced.
0	1	Brooks did better in 1984 when his Terms of Endearment took the lion's share of Oscars, including best picture and director.
0	1	Spielberg's Empire of the Sun won six nominations this year, none of them major and none for director.
0	1	Two years ago, The Color Purple received 11 nominations but not for him as director.
0	1	The Directors Guild nevertheless named him best director that year.
0.275510204081633	1	I'm floored by this, Spielberg said upon receiving his DGA award.
0	1	This is the last thing I expected to happen.
0	1	If some of you are making a statement thank God I thank you for that.
0	1	Why the Spielberg slight?
0.107142857142857	1	Some observers cite the fact that only 257 directors nominate for the Academy Awards, and many are veterans who might not look kindly on the young man whose films are the biggest moneymakers in history
0.670807453416149	1	The Academy appeared to make amends last year by presenting Spielberg with the Irving Thalberg award for consistently high quality of production.
0	1	There was no mention of the fact that Spielberg is primarily a director, not a producer.
0.453781512605042	1	The Thalberg award has come in handy to acknowledge giants who were overlooked for individual awards.
0	1	The recipients have included Cecil B. DeMille, Stanley Kramer, Alfred Hitchcock, Ingmar Bergman and Mervyn Leroy.
0.275510204081633	1	The honorary award has also proved useful to salve the Academy's conscience.
0	1	Charlie Chaplin received one at the first Academy Awards for his creation of The Circus and again at the 44th awards for the incalculable effect he has had in making motion pictures the art form of this century.
0	1	Douglas Fairbanks, Judy Garland, Noel Coward, Ernst Lubitsch, Fred Astaire, Gene Kelly, Harold Lloyd, Greta Garbo, Maurice Chevalier, Stan Laurel, Cary Grant, Lillian Gish, Edward G. Robinson, Groucho Marx, Howard Hawks and Jean Renoir are others who have received honorary awards.
0	1	Cary Grant once remarked that he never expected to win an Academy Award.
0.142857142857143	1	I'd have to blacken my teeth first, he quipped, alluding to the Academy's fondness for actors who portray bums and downtrodden characters.
0	1	Alfred Hitchcock also had a lighthearted comment on why he failed to win an Oscar: I suppose it was a matter of carelessness.
0	1	The overlooking of classic films and the industry's most talented filmmakers has provided historians with cause for dispute.
0	1	For example, Citizen Kane, which customarily places No. 1 on polls of the greatest American films, was nominated in 1941 for best picture for Orson Welles' performance, direction and co-scripting with Herman Mankiewicz, Gregg Toland's camera work, plus art direction, sound, music and editing.
0	1	The only Oscar for Citizen Kane was for the script.
0	1	How Green Was My Valley was named best picture.
0	1	Billy Wilder's classic comedy, Some Like It Hot, failed to be nominated as best picture, as did Chaplin's Modern Times, Hawks' Red River and Woody Allen's Manhattan.
0	1	Oscar might use Joe E. Brown's final line from Some Like It Hot: Nobody's perfect.
0.116883116883117	2	HOLLYWOOD Like all great contests, the annual Academy Awards ceremony has generated a wealth of statistics and trivia over its 60 years of existence, all carefully chronicled by Oscar historians.

0	2	What multiple Oscar winner has never appeared to collect her award?
0	2	Katharine Hepburn, all four times.
1	3	Oscar selection has come under scrutiny as film studios go to new lengths to pull votes out of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.
0	3	And with the flood of Oscar vote enticements from free coffee mugs to complimentary buffet dinners Academy members are acknowledging that some Oscar voting is done by committee, in violation of the rules.
0	3	Secretaries, spouses and friends, several Academy members say, are marking ballots in what is supposed to be the entertainment industry's most esteemed awards competition.
0	3	It's like a local election of judges, said Academy member Harry Clein, who said he's witnessed team voting.
0	3	A lot of people don't know who the candidates are.
0	3	So they take a look at who's around them and see what the consensus is.
0	3	As far as elections go, it's not bad.
0	3	But I've never been through an election in Argentina.
0.113445378151261	3	Dan Lyle, who oversees the Oscar balloting for the accounting firm Price, Waterhouse Inc., said that there is no guarantee that Academy members have actually filled out their own ballots.
0	3	All we know is that a properly numbered ballot has been returned, he said.
0	3	Members are on the honor system to fill out the ballot themselves.
0	3	More than 4,600 members were given ballots this year for the 61st Annual Academy Awards, which will be telecast on March 29 from the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles.
0	3	Academy members vote on their area of specialty.
0.175324675324675	3	The Academy's actors branch, for example, is the only group to select nominees in the four acting categories.
0	3	Since the voting is done secretly members do not sign their ballots the ballot's authenticity is ensured solely by a numeric control number, Lyle said.
0	3	Ballots are invalidated only if there is more than one vote in a given category, and only the votes in that specific category are not tallied, he said.
0.160714285714286	3	Nominations for acting, directing, art direction and all specialized categories are handled by select branches and committees composed of Academy members.
0.321428571428571	3	All voting members of the Academy can participate in the best picture nominations and may vote for the final awards in all categories.
0	3	Winners for best documentary feature, best animated short film and best live-action short film are chosen by only those members who have seen all the nominees.
0	3	Academy constituent Julian Blaustein said that most of his colleagues take the voting very seriously.
0	3	I don't even vote if I'm not familiar with the pictures in that category.
0	3	And I've never told someone to vote for a film, even when I've done some of them.
0.214285714285714	3	Meanwhile, other Oscar voting rules are perhaps being broken, speculates veteran Academy member Millard Kaufman.
0	3	Although you're asked to vote in the nominations for five pictures, I think a lot of people figure out that they have a better chance if they just vote for their own picture and leave the other four blank, he said.
0.220408163265306	3	Given the tremendous impact both an Oscar nomination and an Oscar victory have on a film's fortunes, it's not entirely surprising that a certain degree of artifice might surround the Oscars.
0	3	The Last Emperor took in $18.9 million, close to half the film's gross, after it won last year's best picture trophy.
0	3	More than 70 percent of the revenues generated by 1986's best picture, Platoon, came after the film was nominated.
0.241071428571429	3	On average, a best picture award is worth about $20 million these days.
0	3	A $500,000 Oscar promotional campaign mounted by a studio, therefore, can be a good investment.
0	3	In the case of this year's awards, a flurry of Academy-oriented newspaper advertisements, banquets, complimentary gifts and photo mailings tied to five late releases appears to have been remarkably successful.
0	3	This year, all best picture nominees and the large majority of top acting nominees came from movies released in December: The Accidental Tourist, Dangerous Liaisons, Rain Man and Working Girl were all released after Dec. 16.
0.128571428571429	3	While these five movies might be good, the nearly complete exclusion of films from the rest of the year has highlighted the studios' mastery of Oscar marketing.
0.321428571428571	3	I think the Academy Awards are crap, said Terry Gilliam, director of Brazil and the current The Adventures of Baron Munchausen.
0	3	It's about selling films is all it's about, he said.
0	3	It's one more way of flogging some films.
0.551020408163265	3	When got nominated they asked me to be a member of the Academy.
0	3	And I wouldn't join.
0	3	I just don't want to be a part of that at all.
0.160714285714286	3	And at least one prominent Academy member, director Carl Reiner, says that the manipulation of Oscar voters has reached new depths.
0	3	Reiner said that Universal Studios' all-out effort to bag votes for Sigourney Weaver, a best actress nominee for Gorillas in the Mist, could lead him to vote against the film.
0	3	I have in my house more color reproductions of Sigourney Weaver and a beautiful gorilla than I need, Reiner said of promotional material sent to his home.
0.321428571428571	3	We've got to tell the Academy to stop this advertising.
0	3	I'm getting turned off on the pictures I like.
0.406015037593985	4	Free enterprise has collided with the Academy Awards, and everybody's trying to pick up the pieces.
0.246200607902736	4	With Oscar statuettes selling at auction for more than $10,000 and a Chicago trophy company casting alleged Academy Award clones, the National Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences is scrambling to make sure Oscar's golden sheen isn't tarnished by Hollywood hucksterism.
0.0787172011661808	4	If you know about an infringement and fail to object to it, you risk having your trademark become public domain, said Bruce Davis, the Academy's executive administrator, in explaining the lawsuits the organization has filed to protect its beloved hunk of electroplated pewter.
0.1455525606469	4	But despite the Academy's crusade against crass commercialism, this year's awards ceremony will feature a new merchandising wrinkle: Some 800 limousines delivering the most famous stars to the Oscar telecast will be equipped with door-mounted coolers jammed with Diet Coke, Coca-Cola Classic and other Coca-Cola Co. beverages.
0	4	When the limo doors swing open in front of the Shrine Auditorium and the celebrities tumble out, the Coke logo will be on display in front of an audience that includes millions around the world.
0	4	It seemed like a good marketing opportunity, said Coca-Cola spokesman Ira Gleser.
0.175324675324675	4	The Academy approached our local bottler in Los Angeles and said we're going to have a lot of thirsty people.
0.275510204081633	4	But even as the Academy embraces this new intrusion of merchandising, it has lashed out at whatever else it considers a blemishing of the Oscar name.
0.208494208494209	4	When MGM-UA, the distributor of Rain Man, published newspaper advertisements touting the film's Oscar nominations before the nominations were even announced, the Academy issued a harsh statement condemning MGM-UA's promotional gamble.
0	4	After the ads appeared, Rain Man collected nine nominations.
0.321428571428571	4	We regard this as a serious matter, and we have communicated our concern, said Richard Kahn, president of the Academy.
0.578571428571429	4	For nearly 50 years, the Academy has maintained strict security around both the nominations and the award winners.
0.296703296703297	4	It also has envisoned the statuette itself as something of an icon.
0.771428571428571	4	So auctioning the Oscar has greatly distressed the Academy.
0	4	The Collector's Book Store, local sponsors of monthly entertainment memorabilia auctions, has sold off seven Oscars in the past year, including the best picture trophy for 1951's An American in Paris Marlon Brando's best actor prize for 1954's On the Waterfront and the black and white interior decoration Oscar for 1941's How Green Was My Valley
0	4	None were sold by the original recipients; heirs or friends who had later received the trophies put them on the block.
0.148351648351648	4	When Malcolm Willits, the book store's owner, announced that he would hold a February auction for the 1957 best-picture trophy for Around the World in 80 Days, the Academy said enough, initiating a court action that, for now, has blocked any future trophy sales.
0.257142857142857	4	The Academy insists that a contract signed by Oscar winners mandates that they will not sell the trophies without first offering them to the Academy for a nominal fee.
0.220408163265306	4	But now that the word is out that these awards are worth $10,000 to $50,000, people are reluctant to sell them back to the Academy for $10, Willits said.
0.385714285714286	4	The Academy has created something of great value here.
0	4	This is the most famous award in the world the most instantly recognizable award.
0	4	The Nobel Prize might be a greater honor, but people know more about what an Academy Award looks like.
0	4	And they're very limited, too.
0	4	There's not too many of them around.
0	4	Twenty years ago, you wouldn't have a movie poster in your living room unless you were a college student.
0	4	Now, you can go into Beverly Hills homes and there's a movie poster, and the darn thing's worth $10,000 or $20,000 dollars.
0.203007518796992	4	When the Academy won a court order temporarily blocking future auctions, Willits decided to sell his store.
0	4	It seemed to be the final straw.
0	4	I don't like lawsuits, he said.
0	4	I'm getting older and I'd like to write movie scripts.
0.104247104247104	4	Yet the Academy has lost its most recent attempt to save its trophy's integrity: A copyright infringement suit brought against the Houston International Film Festival was dismissed March 16 in a California federal court.
0.593406593406594	4	The Academy had claimed the Lone Star Statuette, designed and built by Chicago's Creative House Promotions, was practically identical to the Oscar.
0	4	The court found otherwise.
0	5	Spencer Tracy's acting technique was simply less is better, and that helped make him the screen's greatest actor.
0.296703296703297	5	The Tracy credo is recommended to future producers of Academy Award shows.
0	5	Wednesday night's orgy of self-congratulation was dazzling, glamorous and all those familiar Hollywood adjectives.
0	5	Also too much.
0	5	Too many endless production numbers.
0	5	Too much forced conversation between couples.
0	5	Too many awards with meaning lost to the general public.
0	5	The use of couples, co-stars, compadres and companions, as presenters for the 61st Academy Awards at the Shrine Auditorium was clever but wearing.
0.128571428571429	5	The best Oscar shows have been emceed by Will Rogers, Bob Hope, Johnny Carson and other funnymen who provided continuity as well as a leavening of pomposity.
0	5	The brightest moments of the 61st Awards came from Billy Crystal, Robin Williams and Bob Hope, but they were all too brief.
0	5	Tom Selleck remarked that Douglas Fairbanks Sr. handed out the first awards in 1929 in five minutes.
0	5	The present awards could be staged in two hours instead of the 3 hours and 15 minutes they took Wednesday night on ABC-TV.
0	5	But the show will never be shorter.
0	5	Reason: The time is needed to sell all those 30-second adds at $375,000 per.
0.335403726708075	5	Since the Academy Awards are a night of superlatives here are a few more: The most heartfelt acceptance: Dustin Hoffman.
0	5	The most intelligent acceptance: Jodie Foster.
0	5	Warmest reception: Lucille Ball and Bob Hope.
0	5	Best looking legs: Cyd Charisse.
0	5	Second-best looking legs: Martin Short.
0.257142857142857	5	Worst desecration of an icon: Snow White portrayed as a whining would-be starlet.
0	5	Best comedy routine: Billy Crystal imitating Yul Brynner as Babe Ruth.
0	5	Best walk-on music: The Second Time Around for Melanie Griffith and Don Johnson.
0	5	Least promising rock singer: Rob Lowe.
0	5	Most overworked butt of jokes: Vice President Dan Quayle by Crystal, Hope and Williams
0	5	Most prevalent fashion: Strapless gowns.
0	5	Seemingly endless number: Oscar Winners of Tomorrow.
0	5	Most relentless double entendre: Bo Derek and Dudley Moore.
0	5	Most questionable taste: Kurt Russell's proposal of marriage to Goldie Hawn.
0	5	Most mentioned agent: Michael Ovitz of Creative Artists Agency.
0	5	Most recurrent dance routine: The Rockettes-like line of kickers.
0	5	Best exchange of banter: Sean Connery, Michael Caine and Roger Moore.
0	5	Most welcomed elimination: Singing of the nominees for best song.
0	5	Most stunning beauty: Michelle Pfeiffer Worst reader of Teleprompter: Walter Matthau.
0	5	Editors: Wednesday's ceremony was Bob Thomas' 45th Academy Awards.
0.445054945054945	6	The Oscar statuette, one of the most recognizable images in the entertainment world, has no copyright protection, a federal judge has ruled.
0.154285714285714	6	The small Academy Award statue is part of the public domain, U.S. District Court Judge Laughlin Waters said in a ruling released Thursday.
0.771428571428571	6	The decision was a setback for the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, which had sued a Chicago-based manufacturer of an employee-incentive trophy similar to the Oscar.
0	6	Academy President Karl Malden said the ruling comes as a shock to me.
0.551020408163265	6	The academy said it would appeal.
0.248847926267281	6	The academy claimed that the Star Award, the trophy look-alike made by Creative House Promotions, violated copyright laws, diluted the academy's trademark and represented unfair competition.
0.142857142857143	6	The Star Award depicted a naked, muscular male much like the Oscar, just two inches shorter and holding a star instead of a sword.
0.167701863354037	6	It had a gold finish similar to the Oscar, and stood on a circular gold cap mounted on a cylindrical base.
0.222527472527473	6	Although Waters acknowledged that the Creative House trophy is very similar to the Oscar, he rejected all of the academy's legal claims, saying that the statuette became part of the public domain prior to Jan. 1, 1978, the effective date of the Copyright Act of 1976.
0.308571428571429	6	The film industry's top award was distributed from the first ceremony in 1929 until about 1941 without the c mark indicating a copyright.
0.18815331010453	6	The judge ruled, too, that the Oscar not only was an honorary award but also was used to promote the film industry, and therefore did not have a limited purpose, as required by the copyright act.
0.584415584415585	6	The academy noted that the ruling applied only to the statuette and that the academy's trademark and service marks for the Oscar and the Academy Award names and symbols are unaffected.
0.0876623376623377	6	We are surprised that the court would base its decision on events which occurred half a century ago, overlooking the meticulous fashion in which the Academy has protected the integrity of its institutional symbol for decades, Malden said in a statement.
0.120535714285714	7	Spike Lee may have been wearing a Georgetown University cap and sweatshirt, but he got a far warmer reception from Syracuse University students than he did from Academy Award voters.
0.584415584415585	7	In a lecture and question-and-answer session Monday, Lee shrugged off the academy's icy treatment of his latest movie, Do the Right Thing, and blamed it on generational politics.
0.137755102040816	7	The 1989 film, widely hailed by critics, received only two Academy Award nominations, and isn't being considered for best picture or best director.
0.257142857142857	7	The academy's membership consists mainly of old people, the 32-year-old Lee said.
0	7	He said they were a lot more comfortable with the black chauffeur in Miss Daisy' than with the angry characters in his film.
0	7	I still feel we made the best film of the year, he said.
0.183673469387755	7	Asked if racism might have been involved in the academy nominations, Lee replied, Racism's involved in everything.
0	7	Despite the cap and sweatshirt, Syracuse students welcomed him as one of their own.
0	7	He's an African-American, one of the first ones to make it and he's addressing the issues and concerns affecting our community, Syracuse senior Deron Harris said.
0	7	That's why we're so proud of him.
0	8	Well, it did turn out to be Man's" evening, but not until the last few minutes, and if there was a message in Wednesday night's Academy Awards results, it's that parity has returned to Hollywood.
0.192857142857143	8	For two-thirds of the show, the academy voters seemed determined to give an award to every film nominated.
0	8	As it was, 10 different movies split 17 awards, the most winners for one year in this decade.
0.296703296703297	8	The major awards made the forecasters look smart and the academy predictable.
0	8	Man" did win the grand prize and Burning," with just one Oscar for cinematography, did get punished for its highly publicized historical muddling.
0.220408163265306	8	But gone, for a refreshing change, was the slate voting that has turned many recent Academy Awards shows into one-note evenings that kept some deserving people out of the Oscar resale market.
0	8	Man," its director Barry Levinson, Hoffman and the screenwriters may have fulfilled their roles as favorites, but there were no sure things elsewhere, and people looking for early patterns had to throw away the form.
0	8	The final score shows Man" with four Oscars and Liaisons" and Framed Roger Rabbit" with three each.
0	8	But there were seven other films with one award each.
0.0918367346938776	8	Whether the spread represents a change in voting habits, or an absence of a film to rally around, it made for a great show and in some cases, the awards helped right some wrongs in the nominations process.
0.107142857142857	8	That Framed Roger Rabbit" won three of the six awards for which it was nominated may save the academy some embarrassment for neglecting the one 1988 film sure to be regarded as a classic.
0.192857142857143	8	The good news for observers of voter psychology were the awards given to films that were not box-office hits.
0	8	The voters tend to favor those films that are both of substance and commercially successful and whether they even bother to see the other nominees is often questioned.
0	8	This year, several winners came from films that failed to ring up big numbers at the box office: Jodie Foster as best actress from Accused," Geena Davis as best supporting actress from Accidental Tourist."
0.133004926108374	8	More surprising were the awards given to and Milagro Beanfield War," films that divided critics and sent moviegoers off to the video store looking for alternatives.
0.101503759398496	8	Both films were flawed, but the sound editing done for which seamlessly blended old jazz recordings with fresh studio cuts done by contemporary musicians, was brilliant and deserved the award its four-man sound team won.
0	8	David Grusin's Oscar for scoring Milagro Beanfield War" overcame even bigger odds, winning over popular John Williams' score for Accidental Tourist."
0	8	The selective mood of the voters is a reflection of the kind of year the film industry had, and whether the spread is a quirk, one can hope it suggests a trend.
0.226890756302521	8	The 1988 slate of films was, on total, a marked improvement over recent years.
0.167701863354037	8	The industry is still adjusting to its changing its older and more demanding audience and that means a wider variety of films.
0	8	Nominees this year represented as wide a range of material as any in years, and they produced more winning films.
0	8	The events last night played hell with the office pool, but it made for a better show.
0	8	Maybe it's the start of something new.
0.160714285714286	9	Who would have thought that Snow White, of all people, would become the source of Oscar night's only major glitch?
0.794117647058823	9	The Walt Disney Co. filed suit in Los Angeles federal court Thursday against the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, charging copyright infringement of its Snow White character and unfair competition.
0.142857142857143	9	The famous fairy tale character, portrayed by singer-dancer Eileen Bowman, opened Wednesday night's Academy Awards ceremonies with an elaborate, 10-minute song-and-dance routine.
0	9	But Disney contends that the character was used on the show without the company's permission.
0.120535714285714	9	have great respect for the academy and for all that it does," Frank Wells, Disney's president and chief operating officer, said Thursday in a prepared statement.
0.124423963133641	9	were therefore greatly surprised and dismayed when we viewed last evening's Academy Awards ceremonies to see that our Snow White character had been used extensively without our permission."
0.116883116883117	9	Wells said the suit was filed only after the company asked the academy to publicly apologize for its unauthorized use of the character, which debuted in a 1937 full-length cartoon film.
0.175324675324675	9	such a statement had been agreed to by the academy," Wells said, would have considered the matter ended.
0.214285714285714	9	For its own reasons, however, the academy unfortunately did not accede to our request."
0.113445378151261	9	Disney spokesman Erwin Okun did not provide any details of Thursday's negotiations with academy officials over an apology, except to say that the academy's offer not to our satisfaction."
0.175324675324675	9	Bruce Davis, the academy's executive administrator, declined comment, saying top officials needed time to assess the suit.
0	9	haven't gotten any official notification of this," Davis said, adding that he learned of the legal action from a reporter.
0.296703296703297	9	Ironically, the academy is extremely protective of the Oscar name and statuette copyrights and is quick to object to the image's unauthorized use.
0	9	Number Kept Secret
0.275510204081633	9	Alan Carr, who produced the Oscar show, had ordered that the details of the opening number be kept secret until Wednesday night's ABC telecast.
0	9	But in its suit, Disney says a company representative learned of the plans early in the week.
0.241071428571429	9	The company claims that the academy refused to respond to its inquiries until Wednesday afternoon.
0.321428571428571	9	At that point, the Disney statement said, the academy, a legal representative, denied to Disney that the Academy Award program contained any material deleterious to the interests of Disney, without revealing the academy's intention to feature Disney's Snow White."
0	9	Carr could not be reached for comment Thursday.
0.113445378151261	9	The Snow White character as portrayed Wednesday night by Bowman was created by Steve Silver, who for 15 years has used the character in the San Francisco musical revue Blanket Babylon."
0	9	Disney files dozens of suits a year against individuals and companies that copy its characters, particularly in consumer products.
0	9	sue all the time," Okun said.
0.133004926108374	9	But Okun said the company, which won four Oscars Wednesday night, has never sued Silver over his use of the Snow White character in that production.
0	9	The spokesman, however, did not preclude the possibility of a future lawsuit.
0	9	look at these characters as the heart and soul of the company," Okun explained.

0.0689655172413793	1	At midnight EDT the U.S. National Weather Service said Gilbert was centered near latitude 19.9 north, longitude 84.8 west, or about 150 miles east-southeast of Cozumel.
0.333333333333333	1	It said Gilbert was moving west-northwest at about 15 mph with maximum sustained winds of 175 mph.
0	1	The center said tropical storm-force winds extend outward up to 250 miles to the north and 200 miles to the south of the center.
0	1	People in the warned areas should have completed all possible preparations for this extremely dangerous hurricane, it said.
0.555555555555556	1	The center said Hurricane Gilbert was the most intense storm on record in terms of barometric pressure.
0.142857142857143	1	It said by 8 p.m. EDT it was measured at 26.13 inches, breaking the 26.35 inches recorded for the 1935 hurricane that devastated the Florida Keys.
0.470588235294118	1	That's the lowest pressure ever measured in the Western Hemisphere, said forecaster Mark Zimmer.
0.137931034482759	1	There is very serious flooding in the Cayman Islands, Erina Nichols, a tourism official in Miami, said Tuesday after speaking with residents of the islands.
0	1	The Run Point is taking a real beating.
0.16	1	The storm later knocked out all telephone service to the Cayman Islands, a British dependency of 23,000 people that was expecting 12-foot tides.
0.2	1	Warren Chase, an amateur radio operator in Fort Myers, Fla., said he received a report of sailboat with seven people aboard missing near the Cayman Islands.
0	1	Oil companies evacuated thousands of workers from rigs in the Gulf of Mexico, according to reports from New Orleans.
0.0540540540540541	1	Gene Graves, marketing director for Petroleum Helicopters Inc. in Lafayette, La., said his company's 18 helipads were working at full capacity to evacuate about 10,000 oil rigs in the Gulf of Mexico.
0	1	The Cuban news agency Prensa Latina said 40,000 people, many of them foreign vacationers and students, were evacuated Tuesday from the Isle of Youth off the southwestern coast as the hurricane passed 200 miles to the south.
0.0571428571428571	1	In New York City, a ham radio operator who was monitoring amateur radio communications in Jamaica said Tuesday, Kingston is devastated, Montego Bay is hit hard and Ocho Rios is flooded.
0	1	The operator, Norm Chwat, an officer with the American Red Cross Radio Club, said therth coast had been wrecked by the hurricane.
0	1	Herb Schoenbaum, a radio ham operator in the Virgin Islands, said he spoke Tuesday with Dave Porter, an American staying in the Wyndham Hotel on Jamaica's Montego Bay.
0.0869565217391304	1	Porter reported that the hotel apart like a banana' when the force of Hurricane Gilbert hit last night, Schoenbaum said.
0	1	This morning he says there is just nothing left.
0	1	Boats that were on the beach, the little rental Sailfishes or Sunfishes, were driven into cars like spears power lines down, almost every tree in the area is on the ground.
0	1	Schoenbaum said Porter told him people who were trying to enter the hotel on their hands and knees at the height of the storm were swept into the ocean.
0.0555555555555556	1	Glenn Baxter of Belgrade Lakes, Me., said he spoke with a ham operator in Jamaica who told him the roof of a hospital in Mandeville ripped off and the hospital has caved in.
0	1	And that is the worst horror show that I've heard about because that would imply that a lot of people could have been hurt.
0	1	The Jamaican consulate in Miami said today it had n immediate information on the extent of damages or casualties.
0	1	Jamaica was still out of contact with the rest of the world by telephone.
0.0869565217391304	1	Roger Myers, southern regional spokesman for the Federal Aviation Administration in Atlanta, said both international airports in Jamaica are closed.
0	1	We've been told the government has asked commercial radio stations to remain silent so Radio Jamaica can broadcast information, Myers said.
0.551724137931034	2	With the winds of Hurricane Gilbert clocked at 175 miles per hour, U.S. weather officials called Gilbert the most intense hurricane ever recorded in the Western Hemisphere.
0.171428571428571	2	Mark Zimmer, a meterologist at the National Hurricane Center, reported an Air Force reconnaissance plane measured the barometric pressure at Gilbert's center at 26.13 inches at 5:52 p.m. EDT on Tuesday.
0.444444444444444	2	Gilbert was barreling toward Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula.
0.533333333333333	2	That's the lowest pressure ever measured in the Western Hemisphere, Zimmer said.
0.117647058823529	2	The previous record low pressure of 26.35 inches was set by the 1935 Labor Day hurricane that struck the Florida Keys with winds above 150 mph, killing 408 people, he said.
0.0740740740740741	2	With tropical storm force winds extending 250 miles north and 200 miles south of the hurricane's center, Gilbert also was one of the largest.
0	2	But because the circumference of a hurricane changes so often during its course, no records are kept on their overall size, said center meterologist Jesse Moore.
0	2	Hurricane Debby, which barely crossed the 74 mph threshold to hurricane strength before striking Mexico last month, was probably about half that size, Moore said.
0.3	2	Gilbert is one of only three Category 5 storms in the hemisphere since weather officials began keeping detailed records.
0	2	The others were the 1935 Labor Day hurricane and Hurricane Camille, which bulldozed the Mississippi Coast with 172 mph winds and a 28-foot wave in 1969, leaving $1.4 billion in damage and 256 dead.
0	2	A 1900 hurricane is responsible for the worst natural disaster in U.S. history, however.
0	2	That storm hit Galveston, Texas, Sept. 8 and killed more than 6,000 people.
0.384615384615385	2	Category 5 storms have winds greater than 155 mph, barometric pressure of less than 27.17 inches and a storm surge higher than 18 feet.
0	2	The storm surge a great dome of water that follows the eye of the hurricane across coastlines, bulldozing everything in its path accounts for nine out of 10 hurricane fatalities.
0.0740740740740741	2	Camille's storm surge was 25 feet high, but the hurricane center was forecasting a surge of only 8-12 feet for Gilbert, Zimmer said.
0.0625	2	The damage from these worst-case hurricanes is catastrophic shrubs and trees blown down, all street signs gone, roofs and windows blown away and shattered, and mobile homes destroyed.
0	2	Moisture and heat are what drives the hurricane, Zimmer said.
0	2	The engine itself is this tall chimney of warm, moist air in the center.
0	2	If the atmospheric conditions in general allow this warm chimney to build to very high levels, 10-12 miles high, then you can have a severe hurricane.
0.08	2	Category 4 storms cause extreme damage with winds from 131 to 155 mph, surge of 13-18 feet and pressure of 27.17 to 27.90.
0.0714285714285714	2	The weakest hurricanes, Category 1, cause minimal damage with winds of 74 to 95 mph, 4-5 foot surge and pressure at 28.94 or more.
0.444444444444444	3	Hurricane Gilbert battered the resorts of the Yucatan Peninsula today with 160 mph winds and torrential rains.
0	3	Thousands of people fled coastal areas for shelters inland.
0.0833333333333333	3	The wind was blowing out windows everywhere in Cancun, an official said of the resort where thousands of Americans vacation each year.
0	3	Residents along the gulf coast of Texas, 560 miles to the north, stockpiled food and supplies and prepared to evacuate.
0	3	Robert Sheets, director of the National Hurricane Center in Florida, said early today he expects Gilbert to make landfall on the Texas-Louisiana coast in 48 to 60 hours.
0	3	The hurricane, one of the strongest in history, is extremely dangerous, the U.S. National Weather Service said.
0	3	The storm's winds reached 175 mph earlier today, but later fell slightly to 160 mph, the weather service said.
0	3	Oil companies evacuated thousands of workers from rigs in the Gulf of Mexico, according to reports from New Orleans.
0.05	3	Gilbert, which has killed at least 11 people, moved over the island of Cozumel at 10 a.m. EDT, said Jose Pereira, a spokesman for the governor's office in Merida, capital of Yucatan state.
0.296296296296296	3	Pereira, who spoke by telephone from Mexico City, said heavy rain was falling over the peninsula and communications with Cancun and Cozumel were out.
0	3	Cancun is 240 miles east of Medira.
0.222222222222222	3	Cozumel is 12 miles off the Yucatan coast.
0	3	Military and civilian teams evacuated more than 16,000 people from coastal areas on the upper Yucatan coast between Puerto Progreso to Rio Lagartos, Pereira said.
0	3	Most are in shelters in inland towns, he said.
0	3	Many people were reluctant to leave their homes, Pereira said.
0	3	They had to be convinced of the seriousness of the threat.
0	3	Officials in Merida last spoke with people in Cancun early today before the center of the storm hit.
0	3	Electricity is down, he said.
0	3	We talked to them early in the morning and they said it was impressive all dark.
0	3	The people were afraid.
0	3	The wind was blowing out windows everywhere.
0.08	3	Heavy rains began in Merida about 6 a.m. EDT, and the storm was expected to dump 5 to 10 inches on the area.
0	3	The National Weather Service in Miami said the eye of the storm was over northeast Yucatan at noon EDT.
0	3	The center of the storm was located near latitude 20.7 north and longitude 87.3 west, or about 150 miles east of Merida.
0	3	The hurricane was moving toward the west northwest at 15 mph.
0.444444444444444	3	Gilbert pounded the Dominican Republic, Jamaica and the low-lying Cayman Islands Sunday, Monday and Tuesday.
0.222222222222222	3	At least 11 people were reported killed, and at least 60,000 were left homeless in Jamaica.
0.142857142857143	3	Rescue teams worked desperately to restore utilities and communications in the shattered areas.
0	3	In a telephone call early today, receptionist Pablo Torres of the Carrillos Hotel in Cancun said about 150 people, most of them tourists, were crowded in the lobby on sofas and chairs.
0	3	We are full, and there is not one tourist now in the beach hotel zone, he said.
0	3	The sound of the wind outside is horrible.
0	3	You couldn't leave even if you wanted to.
0	3	He said the winds felled utility poles and trees and that sheets of rain were hitting the city.
0	3	Jennie Valdez, a representative of the U.S. Consul, said she did not know how many tourists were in Cancun, but that government figures estimate between 40,000 and 65,000 a month.
0	3	Cancun has a population of about 100,000, she said.
0.0689655172413793	3	High winds also were reported in Valladolid, a city of 80,000 located 80 miles southwest of Cancun, said Jose Joaquin Martil, local Red Cross president.
0.114285714285714	3	Jamaican Prime Minister Edward Seaga said late Tuesday that at least six people were killed, and an estimated 60,000 were left homeless in the worst natural disaster in the modern history of Jamaica.
0.380952380952381	3	Civil defense officials in the Dominican Republic, sideswiped Sunday by the storm, reported five people were known dead.
0.444444444444444	3	The hurricane center said Gilbert was the most intense storm on record in terms of barometric pressure.
0.0909090909090909	3	It was measured at 26.31 inches, breaking the 26.35 inches recorded for the 1935 hurricane that devastated the Florida Keys.
0.470588235294118	3	That's the lowest pressure ever measured in the Western Hemisphere, said forecaster Mark Zimmer.
0.533333333333333	3	Gilbert is a Category 5 storm, the strongest and deadliest type of hurricane.
0.125	3	Such storms have maximum sustained winds greater than 155 mph and can cause catastrophic damage.
0.117647058823529	3	Only two Category 5 hurricanes have hit the United States the 1935 storm that killed 408 people in Florida and Hurricane Camille that devastated the Mississippi coast in 1969 and killed 256 people.
0.235294117647059	4	The most intense hurricane on record surged toward Texas today after battering the Yucatan Peninsula with 160 mph winds, leveling slums, pummeling posh resorts and forcing tens of thousands to flee.
0.212765957446809	4	Hurricane Gilbert, which has left nearly one in four Jamaicans homeless, slackened somewhat as it swirled over land, but the storm was beginning to gain strength over open water as it moved toward the U.S. Gulf Coast with sustained winds of 120 mph.
0	4	The storm was headed west northwest, said National Hurricane Center director Bob Sheets.
0	4	It was moving at 15 mph and dumping up to 10 inches of rain.
0	4	The area that we have the most likely possibility that this hurricane will make landfall is in the northern part of Mexico or the southeastern, southern part of Texas, he said.
0	4	At 3 p.m. today, the center of the storm was near latitude 22.3 north and longitude 92.9 west, or about 380 miles southeast of Brownsville, Texas, the National Weather Service said.
0	4	Brownsville was given a 21 percent probability of being hit, though a hurricane watch was in effect along the entire Texas coast as well as the northeastern Mexican coast from Tampico.
0.4	4	Earlier this week the storm struck the Carribean, ravaging Jamaica, the Dominican Repubic, the Cayman Islands and Haiti, killing at least 19 in Jamaica and five in the Dominican Republic.
0	4	Haiti declared a state of emergency across its southern peninsula, where at least 10 hurricane-related deaths have been reported.
0.166666666666667	4	The storm, about 450 miles wide, hit the Yucatan coast at dawn Wednesday, thrashing beaches with 23-foot waves, uprooting trees, knocking out electricity and water supplies and severing telephone lines.
0	4	Mexican officials reported at least seven injuries.
0	4	There were no reports of deaths.
0	4	Gilbert battered the provincial capital of Merida and the gulf port cities of Puerto Progreso, Campeche and Ciudad del Carmen, closing airports and roads and knocking out communications and power and innundating streets and highways.
0	4	About 20,000 people were evacuated from Puerto Progreso and other coastal towns, a spokesman for the Interior Ministry in Mexico City said by telephone today.
0.444444444444444	4	Hundreds of homes were destroyed, he said.
0.258064516129032	4	The ministry said the storm seriously damaged the luxury hotel zone in the resort of Cancun and destroyed about a quarter of the homes on the nearby island of Cozumel.
0.0952380952380952	4	Ham radio operators in Mexico City also told The Associated Press they had reports of massive damage to several hotels.
0	4	Authorities were particularly concerned about the people trapped on another resort island just off Cancun, tiny Isla Mujeres.
0	4	A navy spokesman in Mexico City said he had no word on the plight of an estimated 15,000 people stranded there.
0.0909090909090909	4	Three ferries linking the island with the mainland were lost in the storm, but there were no reports of casualties.
0	4	In Campeche, boats were driven onto the street running along the waterfront, Ramon Castillo, a night watchman at the newspaper Novedades of Campeche, said in a telephone interview.
0	4	There is no light, there is no radio, there is nothing.
0	4	There is much damage.
0	4	The whole city is flooded, he said.
0.0714285714285714	4	Sheets said the hurricane was expected to hit land midday Friday and that its sustained winds would today certainly increase to 130, 140 miles per hour.
0.0952380952380952	4	It's going to have an impact over a fairly large area, Sheets said on CBS-TV's This Morning.
0	4	Those major destructive winds are going to be in there fairly tight close to the center.
0	4	But the impacts are going to be felt over most of the Texas area.
0.25	4	The hurricane center said Gilbert was the most intense storm on record in terms of barometric pressure, which was measured at 26.31 inches, breaking the 26.35 inches recorded for the 1935 hurricane that devastated the Florida Keys.
0	4	In the Yucatan state capital of Merida, the storm's 160 mph winds destroyed nearly all the thatched houses in one district, uprooted trees, road signs and cut off water supplies, said Gonzalez Correa, news editor of Novedades.
0.0833333333333333	4	A spokeswoman with the National Civil Defense System in Mexico City said at least 20,000 people had flocked to Merida from coastal areas.
0	4	Civil defense officials said 6,000 tourists left beachside motels and 30,000 local people also sought temporary shelter.
0	4	U.S. consular officials said they did not know how many tourists were in Cancun, which receives about 50,000 visitors per month.
0.111111111111111	4	The storm, spawned Saturday southeast of Puerto Rico, appeared to have hit Jamaica the hardest.
0.260869565217391	4	That island nation's prime minister, Edward Seaga, said Wednesday that it destroyed about 100,000 of Jamaica's 500,000 homes.
1	4	He estimated damage at $8 billion.
0.5	4	Earlier Wednesday, Gilbert was classified as a Category 5 storm, the strongest and deadliest type of hurricane.
0.125	4	Such storms have maximum sustained winds greater than 155 mph and can cause catastrophic damage.
0	4	By Wednesday night, the National Hurricane Center downgraded it to a Category 4 and to a Category 3 by this morning.
0.114285714285714	4	Only two Category 5 hurricanes have hit the United States the 1935 storm that killed 408 people in Florida and Hurricane Camille, which devastated the Mississippi coast in 1969 and killed 256 people.
0.193548387096774	5	Thousands of coastal residents from Mexico to Louisiana fled to higher ground Thursday as fierce Hurricane Gilbert sent the first of its storms against Texas after thrashing the Yucatan Peninsula.
0.2	5	This is a killer storm, said Gordon Guthrie, director of the Florida Division of Emergency of Management.
0	5	I feel sorry for anybody wherever this hits.
0.357142857142857	5	The death toll from the storm's onslaught through the Caribbean islands and the Yucatan was at least 47, and damage estimates reached $8 billion.
0	5	Jamaican Prime Minister Edward Seaga declared a one-month public emergency.
0	5	By late evening, a torrential rain was falling in Brownsville.
0.0689655172413793	5	At 11 p.m. CDT, the storm center was near latitude 22.8 north, longitude 94.4 west, or about 275 miles southeast of Brownsville, moving west-northwest between 12 and 15 mph, with maximum sustained winds of 120 mph and accompanied by a 5- to 10-inch rainfall, according to the National Weather Service.
0.148148148148148	5	If this motion continues, the center of the hurricane will cross the coast near the Texas-Mexico border on Friday evening, the weather service said.
0	5	If a northwest turn should occur, the landfall could be further up the Texas coast.
0	5	The weather service issued a hurricane warning for Mexico's northern coast and the southern half of the 370-mile Texas coast from Brownsville to Port O'Connor, including 250,000-resident Corpus Christi.
0.0769230769230769	5	A hurricane watch remained in effect for the remainder of the Texas coast, from Port O'Connor north to Port Arthur near the Louisiana border.
0	5	The weather service said warnings might be extended northward, depending on the path of the 450-mile wide storm.
0	5	Texas Gov. Bill Clements sent National Guard units to Alice, McAllen and Corpus Christi, the first such deployment for the hurricane, to assist in communications and rescue duties.
0	5	Clements also issued an emergency proclamation allowing local authorities to suspend laws to preserve the health, safety and welfare of the public, including such things as the direction of travel on highways.
0	5	Grocery stores ran low on bottled water, batteries, canned tuna and bread as people laid in supplies.
0	5	Homeowners covered windows and doors with plywood and shatter-proofing hurricane tape.
0.166666666666667	5	Offshore oil workers left their rigs in the Gulf of Mexico.
0	5	On Galveston Island, City Manager Doug Matthews recommended Thursday evening that the city's 62,000 residents start evacuating.
0	5	We are dealing with people's lives therefore at 8 o'clock we are recommending evacuation of the island.
0	5	We feel that we cannot wait until the morning to make that decision, Matthews said, adding that roadblocks would be set up at midnight on Interstate 45 to limit access to the island.
0	5	In Brownsville, Texas' southernmost city, winds began to pick up around noon under overcast skies.
0	5	Police said they were asking residents to consider evacuating, but were not ordering it.
0	5	We've never evacuated the city and the point is, where are you going to move 100,000 people?
0	5	said Sgt. Dean Poos.
0	5	A Greyhound-Trailways bus spokesman said the company was doubling its schedule of outbound buses to accommodate those fleeing the storm.
0	5	Lorena Curry, who has lived in Brownsville since 1935, said she plans to ride out the storm.
0	5	I've been through them before.
0	5	I'm going to stick around at my home.
0	5	But she added, I could get along without a hurricane very well.
0.166666666666667	5	Gilbert surged into the gulf after battering the Yucatan Peninsula in Mexico with 160 mph winds, forcing tens of thousands to flee.
0	5	After crossing the peninsula, Gilbert's winds weakened to 120 mph, but forecasters predicted the storm would intensify again as it moves over open water.
0	5	The shower and thunderstorm activity that we see taking place around the hurricane itself is getting better organized, more vigorous, so we think it's starting to strengthen, said Bob Sheets, director of the National Hurricane Center in Miami.
0.111111111111111	5	Sheets said the hurricane's sustained winds would certainly increase to 130, 140 miles per hour.
0	5	In the coastal resort of South Padre Island, about 25 miles southeast of Brownsville, the mayor ordered its 1,000 residents to evacuate.
0	5	We can't force them to leave, but it doesn't make any sense to stay, said Mayor Bob Pinkerton Jr., adding that water and electricity would be turned off Thursday afternoon.
0.0689655172413793	5	Tropical storm force winds, at least 39 mph, extended outward up to 250 miles to the north and 200 miles to the south of the center.
0.4375	5	The storm's first landfall earlier this week left at least 26 people dead in Jamaica, five in the Dominican Republic, 10 in Haiti and the six in Mexico.
0.777777777777778	5	It also left a half-million people homeless in Jamaica and caused widespread damage to the Cayman Islands.
0.129032258064516	5	The storm barreled into the Yucatan coast at dawn Wednesday, thrashing beaches with 23-foot waves, uprooting trees, knocking out electricity and water supplies and severing telephone lines.
0	5	In Campeche, the state capital on the peninusula's west coast, boats and seaweed littered the streets of hundreds of yards from the shore after Gilbert passed through.
0	5	The whole city is flooded.
0	5	Everything is dark, said Ramon Castillo, a watchman at the newspaper Novedades de Campeche.
0	5	I've lived here all my life and I have never seen bad weather like this.
0	5	People are scared.
0	5	Mexican officials reported six deaths, including two babies who drowned, and at least seven people were injured, but authorities were unable to reach many isolated villages.
0	5	Gilbert pounded the provincial capital of Merida and the gulf port cities of Puerto Progreso, Campeche and Ciudad del Carmen, closing airports and roads and knocking out communications and power and flooding streets and highways.
0	5	About 20,000 people were evacuated from Puerto Progreso and other coastal towns, a spokesman for the Interior Ministry in Mexico City said by telephone Thursday.
0.444444444444444	5	Hundreds of homes were destroyed, he said.
0	5	On Mexico's northern coast, people were evacuated from fishing villages and towns into shelters in Matamoros, a city of 400,000 about 12 miles inland near Brownsville.
0.227272727272727	5	The hurricane center said Gilbert at one point was the most intense storm on record in terms of barometric pressure, which was measured Tuesday at 26.13 inches, breaking the 26.35 inches recorded for the 1935 hurricane that devastated the Florida Keys.
0.111111111111111	5	The storm, spawned Saturday southeast of Puerto Rico, appeared to have hit Jamaica the hardest.
0.5	5	Seaga said it destroyed about 100,000 of Jamaica's 500,000 homes.
1	5	He estimated damage at $8 billion.
0	5	Seaga said in a nationwide radio broadcast Thursday that the one-month period of public emergency, including a dawn-to-dusk curfew to prevent looting, was put into effect to enable normalcy to resume in the shortest possible time and to allow the rebuilding process to begin.
0.5	5	On Wednesday, Gilbert was classified as a Category 5 storm, the strongest and deadliest type of hurricane.
0.125	5	Such storms have maximum sustained winds greater than 155 mph and can cause catastrophic damage.
0	5	By Wednesday night, the National Hurricane Center downgraded it to a Category 4 and to a Category 3 by Thursday morning.
0.4	6	Hurricane Gilbert weakened to a tropical storm as it blustered northwestward today but it threw tornadoes and sheets of rain at thousands of shuttered evacuees along the Texas-Mexico border.
0.571428571428571	6	At least 109 people have been killed and more than 800,000 left homeless since Gilbert ripped through the Caribbean with 175 mph wind earlier this week, then crossed the Yucatan Peninsula and Gulf of Mexico before slamming into northeastern Mexico.
0.307692307692308	6	One person died today in Texas after being injured in a tornado.
0	6	But by this morning, the once massive storm's maximum sustained winds had flagged to 65 mph, nine less than hurricane strength, and forecasters said the eye had all but disappeared.
0	6	However, they warned of continued danger from flash flooding inland.
0.13953488372093	6	Gilbert was downgraded to a tropical storm at 6 a.m. EDT as it proceeded 50 miles southeast of the city of Monterrey in northern Mexico, said Noel Rishnychok, a meteorologist with the National Hurricane Center in Coral Gables, Fla.
0	6	Winds were still weakening as the storm moved west-northwest at 12 mph, he said.
0.216216216216216	6	Gulf Coast residents expressed relief that the storm, which earlier was deemed the most powerful ever tracked in the Western Hemisphere, pulled its punch as it came ashore despite delivering a spate of tornadoes.
0	6	We're thankful, said Betty Turner, mayor of Corpus Christi.
0	6	What could have been one of the most deadly storms in history appears to have missed us.
0.0769230769230769	6	Corpus Christi residents who evacuated were eager to return, but Turner said, We're saying don't do it because of the flooding.

0.0476190476190476	6	Gilbert's remnants should bring very heavy rains to Rio Grande valley before heading north up the Mississippi River Valley as a huge rain-making machine, said Mark Zimmer, meteorologist at the National Hurricane Center in Coral Gables, Fla.
0.142857142857143	6	The danger of flash flooding in Texas is very great, Zimmer said.
0	6	Rainfall as high as 10 to 15 inches maybe even 20 inches is expected.
0	6	By midweek, the storm should be in the lower Ohio River Valley and end up in the Great Lakes as nothing more than foul weather, forecasters said.
0	6	The people in the Midwest better dust off their umbrellas, Zimmer said.
0.142857142857143	6	Gilbert, responsible for billions of dollars in damage during a weeklong rampage across the Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico, barreled ashore Friday afternoon in Tamaulipas state, a sparsely populated area of Mexico about 120 miles south of Brownsville.

0	6	When the eye of the storm passed to the south, evacuees were eager to return to their homes.
0	6	We're going home.
0	6	We think everything is going to be OK, Philip Gibbons said Friday night, leaving a Brownsville shelter into a downpour.
0	6	We don't think it's going to get bad and there was no need to stay here anymore.
0	6	Others, however, were more cautious.
0	6	I wouldn't want to go home and then have my family hurt by a tornado, said Praxedis Lindsey, 25, of Brownsville, who was at a shelter with his pregnant wife and son.

0.114285714285714	7	Rains from Hurricane Gilbert sent a river raging over its banks in Monterrey, sweeping at least 10 policemen to their deaths and overturning buses loaded with evacuees from Matamoros, police said today.
0	7	The flooding occurred in Monterrey, an industrial city of 3 million people, located 110 miles from the Texas border and 140 miles inland from Matamoros.
0	7	At least 10 police officers were swept away while on a rescue mission around midnight, a judicial police officer said.
0	7	Several buses loaded with evacuees overturned in the raging water and more were feared drowned.
0	7	The officer, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said early today it had been raining for more than 24 hours.
0	7	A trailer truck also slid into the Santa Catarina river in the driving rain and its two occupants were missing, the local newspaper El Norte said.
0	7	Recreational areas with soccer fields, basketball courts, tennis courts and jogging trails have been built along the river in the last few years.
0	7	Monterrey is a major northern industrial center and the capital of Nuevo Leon state.
0	7	The Santa Catarina river crosses Monterrey.
0.133333333333333	7	The storm slammed into Mexico for the second time in a week Friday afternoon.
0	7	The eye of 450-mile-wide hurricane, with 120 mph winds, crossed onto land at 5:35 p.m. EDT, sweeping ashore in a sparsely populated area 120 miles south of Brownsville, Texas, weather reports said.
0.285714285714286	7	Although the storm had lost much of its muscle, it caused floods and mudslides after it barreled into Mexico.
0.2	7	Earlier in the week, Gilbert killed at least 29 and left 300,000 people homeless in the Yucatan Peninsula.
0.388888888888889	7	The hurricane has killed at least 109 people, including one in Texas, 39 in Mexico, 26 in Jamaica, 30 in Haiti, five in the Dominican Republic and eight in Honduras.
0	7	However, the death toll is expected to rise.
0.0666666666666667	7	In Matamoros just across the Rio Grande from Brownsville, the storm felled trees, downed power lines and flattened dozens of tin shack homes on the evacuated beachfront.
0	7	About 5,000 people were evacuated inland.

0.333333333333333	7	Much of the Yucatan Peninsula remained without communications and supplies today.
0	7	At 9 a.m. EDT today, Gilbert's center was located near latitude 25.1 north and longitude 100.3 west, or 185 miles west southwest of Brownsville and 40 miles south of Monterrey, said the National Hurricane Center in Florida.
0.0833333333333333	7	Maximum sustained winds were estimated to be near 50 mph and the storm was expected to weaken further during the next 24 hours.
0	7	The center said rainfall of 10 to 15 inches was accompanying the storm with up to 20 inches locally.
0	7	Flash floods were likely, it said.
0	7	The storm was moving west-northwest at about 12 mph, and was expected to follow that track through midday today before turning gradually to the northwest, forecasters said.

0	7	Up to now the damages are not considered very grave, said Jose Inez Gonzalez, a Matamoros government spokesman.
0	7	Officials distributed crackers and water to thousands of people in shelters and rged them to stay put until the storm ended.
0	7	Gilbert hit Soto la Marina, a town of 8,000 people 20 miles inland from La Pesca on late Friday, its mayor told The Associated Press by telephone.
0.222222222222222	7	There is considerable material damage to the town.
0	7	It is still raining very hard, said Mayor Ruben Hinojosa Cortina.
0	7	We will just have to stay in and wait until tomorrow to survey the situation.
0	7	Hinojosa Cortina said about 3,000 refugees from La Pesca were sheltered in Soto la Marina but other coastal residents had not been evacuated or decided to ride out the storm.
0	7	The Sierra de Tamaulipas, a small mountain range between Monterrey and the coast, should blunt the hurricane's strength, said Mark Zimmer, a meterologist at the National Hurricane Center.
0	7	Zimmer expected the last of hurricane-force winds today.
0.173913043478261	7	But he predicted very heavy rains as warm hurricane winds rise into cooler mountain air, possibly causing flash floods and mudslides.
0.0769230769230769	7	The Mexican armed forces began emergency flights Friday of food, medicines and water to Cancun, Cozumel and other disaster sites in the Yucatan.
0.0909090909090909	7	In many locations, hurricane victims were without food, drinking water, electrical power, gasoline and communications since Wednesday.

0	8	still gaining strength.
0	8	It's certainly one of the larger systems we've seen in the Caribbean for a long time," said Hal Gerrish, forecaster at the National Hurricane Center in Coral Gables, Fla.
0.142857142857143	8	At 3 p.m. EDT, the center of the hurricane was about 100 miles south of the Dominican Republic and 425 miles east of Kingston, Jamaica.
0	8	The hurricane was moving west at about 15 mph and was expected to continue this motion for the next 24 hours.
0	8	Forecasters said the hurricane's track would take it about 50 miles south of southwestern Haiti.

0.360294117647059	0	Jurors who have reached verdicts on 52 counts in the McMartin preschool molestation case said Wednesday they are deadlocked on the remaining 13 charges in the nation's longest, costliest criminal trial.
0.0486111111111111	0	Superior Court Judge William Pounders received a note from the jurors as they ended their day's deliberation and called a hearing for Thursday to discuss the deadlock and possibly opening the 52 sealed verdicts.
0.122093023255814	0	In an interview Wednesday evening, Pounders said he would deal with the deadlocked counts first, either declaring a mistrial on those counts and reading the sealed verdicts, or sending the jury back to resume deliberations on the undecided counts.
0.25	0	He said the verdicts could also be read before sending the jury back.
0.0795454545454546	0	However, the judge noted that The attorneys are hopeful all the counts will be resolved before we take any verdicts.
0.0875	0	Pounders said he would discuss the matter with attorneys before quizzing jurors on whether they want to deliberate further.
0.414473684210526	0	The jurors are deciding whether Raymond Buckey, 31, and his mother, Peggy McMartin Buckey, 63, are guilty or innocent of charges they molested children at their family-owned McMartin Pre-School in Manhattan Beach.
0.388888888888889	0	The jury that spent 2{ years hearing evidence in the case have agreed on 52 verdicts.
0	0	They have all been sealed.
0.194444444444444	0	None of the verdicts is official until it is announced in court and affirmed by the jury.
0	0	Jurors are in their ninth week of deliberations.
0.2625	0	Buckey and his mother are charged with 64 counts of child molestation and the one shared count of conspiracy.
0.0921052631578947	0	One of the charges which apparently has divided the jurors is the conspiracy charge which names both defendants.
0	0	Jurors asked twice for an explanation of how they could convict one defendant and acquit the other on that joint charge, but seemed perplexed after they received an explanation earlier Wednesday.
0.159090909090909	0	After conferring with lawyers, Pounders told jurors they could convict just one of the defendants on the charge if you feel that the defendant conspired with one or more other persons.
0	0	However, he noted the conspiracy count includes eight alleged overt acts, some of them naming only one defendant.
0.159090909090909	0	A split verdict, he said, would require elimination of overt acts alleged against a defendant acquitted of the charge.
0	0	It was at that point, he said, that some jurors began shaking their heads in confusion.
0.194444444444444	0	Buckey and his mother were the only defendants required to stand trial after an 18-month preliminary hearing.
0.35	0	Five women teachers who worked at the McMartin Pre-School had charges against them dismissed.
0.12962962962963	0	Among those were Buckey's sister, Peggy Ann, and his grandmother, Virginia McMartin, who founded the prestigious but now defunct nursery school.
0	0	On Tuesday, deliberations were halted at midday because a juror became ill.
0	0	On Wednesday, the talks did not begin until 1 p.m. because another juror's child was ill.
0.21875	0	No alternates remain in the case and the judge has worried that losing one of the 12 remaining jurors would force a mistrial.
0.212121212121212	1	Thursday's acquittals in the McMartin Pre-School molestation case outraged parents who said prosecutors botched it, while those on the defense side proclaimed a triumph of justice over hysteria and hype.
0.5	1	Mother-and-son defendants Peggy McMartin Buckey, 63, and Raymond Buckey, 31, wept as the verdicts were announced.
0.0921052631578947	1	Jurors found the pair innocent of 52 charges and couldn't reach a verdict on 13 other counts.
0.269230769230769	1	Prosecutors must decide whether to try those charges in a new trial.
0	1	I just said, told you Ray,' Mrs. Buckey said.
0.175	1	Asked if her son was surprised, she said.
0	1	He had fear, definitely.
0	1	Buckey avoided reporters and slipped out the courthouse with his lawyer.
0	1	If it can happen to seven innocent people it can happen to you, too.
0	1	If it had not been in my faith in God I wouldn't be here today, she said.
0.291666666666667	1	But several parents of former students at the school said the Buckeys won because the system lost.
0	1	It was never done properly, said parent Alan Lagunoff, who moved to Central California from suburban Manhattan Beach.
0	1	I have to sit back and figure out what to do with my son.
0	1	I fear that because of this verdict, no child will be seen as a credible witness from now on.
0.0795454545454546	1	His son, now 10, attended the school for 1{ years but wasn't a witness at the trial.
0	1	I don't think it's worth it to bring this thing back into the courts.
0	1	It will just be another six-year travesty, Lagunoff said.
0.116666666666667	1	The system is not going to protect children, said Jackie McGauley, a parent who believes her child had been molested but didn't testify in the case.
0.109375	1	I don't know what the message is that the jury wanted to get out.
0	1	I'm anxious to hear that.
0.15	1	Charles Buckey, father of Raymond and husband of Mrs. Buckey, suggested Deputy District Attorney Lael Rubin, who prosecuted the case for its entire six years, was motivated by personal ambition.
0	1	My concern primarily was Lael Rubin, who is goes' in order to secure a conviction.
0	1	If you don't win, you don't get promoted, he said.
0.416666666666667	1	Juror Brenda Williams said the evidence failed to convince the jury beyond a reasonable doubt in 52 of the charges.
0.375	1	Even if you accept that the children were molested, it didn't necessarily mean they were molested at the McMartin Pre-School, Ms. Williams told reporters.
0.134615384615385	1	Raymond Buckey spent nearly five years in jail without bail during the case, which defense attorneys said was the result of community hysteria sparked by bizarre allegations by the alcoholic mother of one child at the preschool.
0	1	Some observers accused then-District Attorney Robert Philibosian of using the spectacular charges to boost his failing re-election campaign against Ira Reiner, who beat him and now runs the district attorney's office.
0	1	Philibosian, however, insisted he would not have handled the matter differently.
0	1	Ira Reiner has had that case for five years, and I am not going to take any public criticism directed at me.
0	1	Let him respond to the criticism, said Philibosian, now in private law practice.
0.0603448275862069	1	Also criticized was the decision by investigators to use a private child therapy group, Children's Institute International, to conduct the original interviews with the children.
0	1	Defense attorneys maintained that questions by the institute's researchers were leading and prejudicial.
0.102941176470588	1	We never got the children's stories in their own words, said juror John Breese.
0	1	Children's Institute officials didn't immediately return telephone calls seeking comment.
0.52027027027027	1	Originally, there were seven defendants, including Raymond Buckey's sister, Peggy Ann Buckey, and Virginia McMartin, the founder of the school, mother of Mrs. Buckey and grandmother of Raymond Buckey.
0.241379310344828	1	Hundreds of allegations of child molestation were filed in the case, which gained worldwide attention with its tales of underground tunnels at the school and Satanic rituals.
0.134615384615385	1	The focus of the case shifted dramatically over the years as Reiner reduced the number of charges and dropped five defendants after reviewing the case.
0	1	The underground tunnels were never found.
0	1	No proof was ever produced of Satanic rituals.
0	1	Reiner said the system must be changed to prevent such long, expensive prosecution.
0	1	It took far too long and cost far too much money to have what has been called perfect justice.
0.14	1	We need reform, Reiner said, adding that in trying to describe the case, Insane is the word that comes to mind.
0.318181818181818	1	The case was the longest and the costliest in American judicial history, at 2{ years and $15 million.
0.0648148148148148	1	Superior Court Judge William Pounders said he did what he could to limit its length, cutting 50 witnesses and narrowing the scope of the case.
0	1	For parents and others, there was more to ponder than legal questions.
0	1	Life is not fair.
0	1	I tell my children all the time there is no such thing as fair, said Robert Currie, whose son attended McMartin but didn't testify at the trial.
0	1	It's really a travesty for a case to take this long, said Ms. Rubin, the prosecutor.
0.276315789473684	1	only for the families, the children in this case, but also for the defendants as well.
0.3125	2	Jurors in the McMartin Pre-School molestation case denounced the techniques of a child therapy center and a police department letter that inflamed parents and ignited the case.
0.409574468085106	2	Seven jurors who spoke with reporters in a joint news conference after acquitting Raymond Buckey and his mother, Peggy McMartin Buckey, on 52 molestation charges Thursday said they felt some children who testified may have been molested but not at the family-run McMartin Pre-School.
0.152173913043478	2	And they said some children may have merely repeated stories told them by their parents and interviewers at Children's Institute International.
0.0673076923076923	2	The private child therapy center, which specializes in abused children, videotaped interviews with children from the McMartin school after reports of molestations surfaced.
0	2	Jurors saw the tapes in which interviewers used anatomically explicit puppets and leading questions to elicit descriptions of molestation from children.
0	2	Asked what led to acquittals, juror Brenda Williams focused on the taped interviews from the center jurors call CII.
0	2	The CII interviews I could not accept them, Mrs. Williams said.
0.145833333333333	2	I believe the children believe what they were saying was true.
0.0583333333333333	2	But at CII, I could not tell if the children were saying what was told to them or if they were repeating what their parents had told them.
0.0546875	2	If the CII tapes had not been entered into evidence and I had not seen them, I could have believed the children a little more,' Mrs. Williams said.
0	2	The CII tapes did not help me.
0	2	They gave me a lot of reasonable doubt, agreed juror Julie Peters, 47, a supermarket meat wrapper.
0.109375	2	The children were never allowed to say in their own words what happened to them.
0	2	All the questions were leading.
0	2	They never had a chance to tell their stories, said juror John Breese, 51, a medical technician and grandfather of five.
0.0921052631578947	2	I tried to believe the children, said juror Daryl Hutchins 28, an oil company lease operator.
0.159090909090909	2	But if the child was so contaminated I couldn't.
0.152173913043478	2	Equal criticism was aimed at a letter sent in 1983 by the Manhattan Beach Police Department to parents of McMartin school children.
0.0972222222222222	2	The letter alerted parents to a claim of molestation at the school and to Buckey's arrest.
0	2	The police letter should never have been sent, said juror Sally Cordova, 27, a supermarket checker.
0	2	It put the information out there too early.
0	2	The whole city knew.
0.0833333333333333	2	At that point, jurors said, they felt parents had been programmed to believe their children had been molested.
0.0795454545454546	2	One child said his parents told him that he was molested even before he went to CII, Mrs. Williams recalled.
0.14	2	The panelists said they threw out entirely the most fantastic allegations, including some children's accounts of being molested in a car wash.
0	2	We just dismissed those, said Mrs. Williams.
0	2	They said a series of medical slides shown to them lacked impact because they weren't sure what they were seeing in the photos of children's genitals.
0.116666666666667	2	Although they acquitted defendants of most charges, the jurors deadlocked on 13 counts.
0.181034482758621	2	Some said they were unsure whether Buckey was a molester but were sure the prosecution had failed to prove its molestation allegations against him beyond a reasonable doubt.
0.166666666666667	2	Jurors said they didn't rule out that some children in the case were molested but not by these defendants.
0.362068965517241	2	Even if you accept that the children were molested, said juror Mark Bassett, the evidence didn't establish that they were molested at the McMartin Pre-School.
0	2	The panelists said they were aware of the trial's enormous toll on defendants as well as children and parents.
0	2	I think everybody is a victim, said Ms. Peters.
0	2	I don't think anybody came out of this case a winner.
0	2	I think it's sad because everybody lost something.
0.21875	2	The defendants their lives have been ruined.
0	2	They lost their business, their reputation.
0.145833333333333	2	Mrs. Williams added, The children have to live with this.
0	2	The parents have to live with this.
0	2	There's nothing I can say that will make it better.
0	2	As for themselves, the jurors said their lives were put on hold for nearly three years.
0	2	Bassett lost his job as a research computer scientist when his company folded.
0	2	Mrs. Williams got married.
0	2	Breese said his wife died during the trial and he has since remarried.
0	2	It's been very hard, said Mrs. Williams, a telephone company service representative.
0	2	There were days when I thought I couldn't stand it anymore.
0	2	I don't really know my job anymore, she said.
0	2	It's going to be hard getting back into the real world.
0.175	2	The jury foreman and four other jurors declined interviews.
1	3	The McMartin Pre-school molestation case was the longest criminal trial in U.S. history.
0.186170212765957	3	Here is a chronology of the case: 12, 1983: Judy Johnson makes a phone call to Manhattan Beach Police Department and tells Detective Jane Hoag that she believes her 2{-year-old son was molested by Raymond Buckey at the McMartin Pre-School.
0.0833333333333333	3	7, 1983: Ms. Hoag arrests Buckey, but he is released later that day for lack of evidence.
0.0472972972972973	3	Police continue the investigation and stir controversy by sending letters to 200 parents naming Buckey as a child molestation suspect and asking them to interrogate their children about oral sex, fondling of genitals and sodomy.
0	3	of 1983 to spring of 1984: Nearly 400 children are interviewed by Children's Institute International, and 41 are listed as victims in a complaint filed by the state.

0.712962962962963	4	The jury on Thursday acquitted Raymond Buckey and his mother, Peggy McMartin Buckey, of 52 child molestation counts and deadlocked on 13 other counts.
0	4	Therapist Kee McFarlane later defended her work with hundreds of McMartin students, and suggested that the goals of therapy are at odds with the legal standards required for a successful criminal prosecution.
0	4	What is in the interest of children is not always in the interest of the legal system, she said.
0.35	4	Evidence introduced by prosecutors in what became the longest and most expensive criminal trial in U.S. history included videotaped interviews of the alleged victims.
0	4	Many of the interviews were conducted at an early stage of the sexual abuse investigation by MacFarlane, a social worker and director of the Child Sexual Abuse Center at Children's Institute International.
0.145833333333333	4	MacFarlane said Thursday she still believes children from the school had been molested and that they had not fabricated their accounts of abuse.
0	4	This agency would never have gone all the way through what we have if we did not believe these children, she said.
0.0972222222222222	4	At least seven jurors who attended a news conference agreed the evidence showed children had been molested.
0	4	But the jurors were sharply critical of the interviewers' technique at the institute.
0.0833333333333333	4	The children were never allowed to say in their own words what happened to them, said juror John Breese.
0	4	All the questions were leading.
0.0546875	4	If the CII tapes had not been entered into evidence and I had not seen them, I could have believed the children a little more, juror Brenda Williams said.
0	4	But MacFarlane said that the interviewing techniques were sound, noting that small children must be interviewed differently than adults.
0	4	I didn't put words into their mouths, she said.
0	4	I tried to enable them to get over their fears.
0.0795454545454546	4	MacFarlane acknowledged that some procedures could have been done differently, including conducting more interviews over a longer period of time.
0.0875	4	She called the outcome of the case a tragic consequence of an attempt to prevent trauma to these children.
0.166666666666667	4	But the institute's executive director, Mary M. Emmons, said some good may come out of the case.
0.07	4	It has greatly increased the awareness about the issue of child sexual abuse and about the problems of prosecuting these cases, she said.
0.233333333333333	5	There was plenty of blame to go around at the end of the lengthy and traumatic McMartin Pre-School molestation trial, but no one was willing to accept it.
0.75	5	In the nation's longest and costliest trial, Raymond Buckey and his mother, Peggy McMartin Buckey, were acquitted Thursday on 52 child molestation charges.
0.65625	5	The jury deadlocked on 13 other charges.
0.116666666666667	5	Afterward, the district attorney who filed the case criticized the current district attorney.
0	5	The current district attorney blamed his predecessor and defense attorneys.
0.25	5	And some of the parents of children who attended the school blamed everybody.
0.116666666666667	5	The system is not going to protect children, said Jackie McGauley, a parent who believes her child had been molested but didn't testify in the case.
0.109375	5	Life is not fair, said Robert Curry, whose son attended the McMartin school.
0	5	I tell my children all the time there is no such thing as fair.
0.102941176470588	5	The district attorney who originally pursued the case said he would not have done anything differently.
0.04375	5	Robert Philibosian, now in private practice, angrily dismissed accusations that he played up the McMartin case in 1984 with the news media acting as eager accomplices to boost his public profile as he ran for district attorney.
0	5	I was a professional prosecutor for 16 years before this case was brought, he said.
0	5	To have people who know very little about professional or prosecutorial ethics, to criticize me personally that I have some political motive is totally unjustified.
0	5	Philibosian instead pointed the finger at the man who defeated him, current District Attorney Ira Reiner.
0.125	5	Philibosian said Reiner hurt prosecutor's chances by dismissing charges against five of the original seven defendants and criticizing the case in a 1986 60 Minutes interview.
0	5	But Reiner, calling his dismissal of charges for lack of evidence the decision we're proud of, said the trial took so long because of the state's ponderous criminal justice system, delay tactics by defense attorneys and a mess left behind by Philibosian.
0	5	This is a case I inherited, Reiner said.
0.403846153846154	5	In interviews, many jurors said they believed some of the children were molested, but the prosecution never established that the defendants were responsible.
0.375	5	Even if you accept that the children were molested, it didn't necessarily mean they were molested at the McMartin Pre-School, said juror Brenda Williams.
0.116666666666667	6	Ray Will Die is scrawled in big black letters on the faded green paint of the McMartin Pre-School, testimony to the rage inflamed by the notorious child-molesting case.
0.608695652173913	6	Former McMartin teachers Raymond Buckey and his mother, Peggy McMartin Buckey, were acquitted Thursday of 52 charges of molesting students.
0.21875	6	Jurors were deadlocked on 13 other counts.
0.13125	6	Whatever happens on those charges, few in this upper-middle-class Los Angeles suburb would disagree with the judge in the trial, William Pounders, who once said, The case has poisoned everyone who had contact with it.
0.189189189189189	6	Sue Brown, a receptionist at a medical office across the street from the school, said she had two friends who were involved in the case and had been convinced of the Buckeys' guilt.
0	6	I think they got off scot-free, Brown said.
0	6	I'm really sick about it.
0.0583333333333333	6	Alan Lagunoff, whose son, now 10, testified against the Buckeys, stood in front of the run-down, long-closed nursery school and talked about his disappointment.
0.28	6	The defense did everything to prolong the case and the prosecution did not do enough research to prosecute the case properly, he said.
0	6	A cold wind blasted leaves across the schoolyard as Lagunoff leaned on the rusted chain-link fence surrounding the dilapidated L-shaped building.
0.102941176470588	6	I'd like to see the school become a center for abused children, he said.
0	6	It should be put to some good use rather than tear it down.
0	6	But another longtime Manhattan Beach resident disagreed.
0	6	I'd like to see it torn down, said Brenda Platt.
0	6	I'd like to have no memories of this.
0.0603448275862069	6	Platt, who has two children aged 1 and 3, said she has serious doubts about placing them in a day-care center because of the McMartin trial.
0	6	I think is a disgrace to Manhattan Beach and society.
0	6	It's totally upsetting, Platt said.
0	6	Linda Geisert, another resident of the beach city, was also upset.
0	6	I'm greatly disappointed in the legal system and quite frankly in the jurors, Geisert said.
0.0875	6	For all his disappointment, Lagunoff said he did not feel the prosecutors should retry the remaining 13 counts.
0	6	It would be just more of the same circus, he said.
0.102941176470588	6	We put so much faith and hope in our courts, said Robert Canter, 74.
0	6	And this is what we get frustration.
0.488372093023256	7	Ray Buckey and his mother, Peggy McMartin Buckey, were found not guilty Thursday of molesting children at the family-run McMartin Pre-School in Manhattan Beach, a verdict which brought to a close the longest and costliest criminal trial in history.
0.0448717948717949	7	An eight-man, four-woman jury 10 of the members parents themselves acquitted the Buckeys of 52 counts of molestation after deliberating for nine weeks over evidence that had been presented over the course of more than two years.
0.2625	7	The jury reported it was deadlocked on 13 remaining counts, and a mistrial was declared on those allegations.
0.0514705882352941	7	Ray Buckey, 31, left the courtroom without comment free on his own recognizance until a decision is reached on whether the district attorney will retry him on the 13 undecided counts.
0	7	But his 63-year-old mother and co-defendant reacted with anger.
0	7	gone through hell and now we've lost everything," she said outside the court.
0	7	concern was for my son and what they've done to him because my son would never harm a child."
0.371212121212121	7	Most jurors said later that they believed the children who testified had been molested, but that the prosecution had failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the Buckeys were culpable.
0	7	am not convinced that he is innocent," said juror Sally Cordova, 27, a supermarket checker.
0	7	it was not proven to me that he did it.
0	7	Whether I believe he did it and whether it was proven are very different."
0.134615384615385	7	The end of the case came in a tense and crowded courtroom.
0.109375	7	The Buckeys, who spent years in jail as the case progressed through the judicial system, had sat silently, staring straight ahead, as the jury filed into the room shortly before 10:30 a.m. and the gallery of reporters and spectators grew quiet in anticipation.
0.0760869565217391	7	the verdicts are the same," said Los Angeles Superior Court Judge William Pounders, handing them to his court clerk.
0.0583333333333333	7	Clerk Stan Ferrell listed the counts numerically and then, reading from the verdict form, delivered in a single, almost anti-climactic sentence the historic trial's close:
0.375	7	the jury in the above entitled actions find the defendants not guilty."
0	7	The quiet of the courtroom was split by a few gasps and sobs.
0.102941176470588	7	At first, the defendants remained stoic, then their eyes began to rim with tears.
0	7	Ray Buckey's lower lip quivered.
0.175	7	His mother dabbed at her eyes with a handkerchief.
0	7	They said nothing.
0.477272727272727	7	Afterward, Peggy McMartin Buckey insisted she was not bitter.
0	7	knew God would set my son and me free because we have done nothing," she said as she was driven away.
0.0648148148148148	7	Her optimism was not matched by her son, however, who she said had fear, definitely," about what the jury would decide.
0.0448717948717949	7	held his hand," Buckey's mother said after the verdicts were announced, I told him: told you, Ray,' and he felt like he wanted to cry but he didn't."
0.2625	7	The acquittals concluded the longest criminal trial in history, a case that stemmed from a 2 1/2-year-old's report to his mother six years ago that he had been sodomized at his school by a Ray."
0.0564516129032258	7	The case ultimately cost taxpayers more than $15 million, altered scores of lives and careers, and provided a national focal point for the issue of child abuse.
0.0648148148148148	7	Judge Pounders said he was not surprised by the verdicts: found it difficult to determine how they would view the evidence in the first place.
0.07	7	I thought that based on the evidence that was presented, the jury could do almost anything and still find rational support for it.
0	7	is very difficult to test the credibility of children, and when you go beyond that, the natural tendency for adults is to look for corroboration.
0	7	It was very difficult to find corroboration in this case."
0.14	7	Asked if the case was worth its cost in money, lives and stress, Pounders said he thinks society benefited from the case.
0	7	will be much more alert to the possibility of this type of offense taking place at preschool and at schools," Pounders said.
0	7	are no longer dropping their children off and walking away blindly.
0	7	They look back.
0	7	They check things out more."
0.154411764705882	7	In the crowded courthouse hallways, parents of alleged victims lashed out at the prosecutors for bungling the case and insisted that their children had not been well served by the judicial system.
0	7	system doesn't allow us to protect kids," said the father of two alleged victims.
0	7	have no doubt these children were abused.
0	7	Said a tearful mother: guess maybe it's OK to kids!
0	7	I can't believe this."
0.159090909090909	7	The children themselves reacted calmly and stood by their accounts.
0	7	all know that we are telling the truth," said a 15-year-old boy who had testified.
0.116666666666667	7	matter what the jury says, whatever anybody says, this is the truth.
0.35	7	We were molested."
0.152173913043478	7	Another of the children said that, when the clerk read guilty" on the verdict form, stomach just hollowed out.
0	7	I was beyond tears.
0	7	Those words will stick with me probably the rest of my life.
0	7	I'll never forget those two words."
0	7	Jurors were critical of the prosecutors' methods.
0.0673076923076923	7	In particular, they cited the prosecution's reliance on videotapes of controversial pretrial interviews of the young witnesses at a Los Angeles child-abuse center.
0	7	They also criticized the Manhattan Beach Police Department's decision, early in the investigation, to send out form letters to parents announcing an investigation had begun and soliciting information.
0	7	children," said juror John Breese, 51, a biomedical technician, never allowed to say in their own words what happened to them.
0	7	That was crucial."
0	7	Said jury foreman Luis Chang, an electrical engineer: key evidence that swayed me was the interview tapes.
0	7	They were too biased, too leading.
0	7	That's the main crux of it."
0.053030303030303	7	All said they had entered the jury deliberation room with open minds, not only because the judge had so instructed, but also because the disjointed testimony had left them confused.
0.128048780487805	7	went into the jury room as confused and uncertain as I was the day I first sat in the jury box the first day of this trial," said Brenda Williams, 38, a Pacific Bell service representative.
0	7	felt I had missed out on something, maybe I had dozed off during some important testimony and I was hoping some of my fellow jurors had something in their notes that I didn't have in mine that would make it all come together."
0	7	Said juror Mark Bassett, 33, a computer specialist: just didn't really know what happened."
0.1875	7	Atty Lael Rubin, who prosecuted the case, said a decision has not been made about whether to pursue the 13 counts involved in a mistrial.
0.238636363636364	7	These counts involve 12 molestation charges against Ray Buckey, and a conspiracy count that accused both him and his mother.
0.291666666666667	7	The conspiracy count against Peggy McMartin Buckey was dismissed outright Thursday.
0.0921052631578947	7	ultimately must respect the jury's decision," Rubin said, though I personally disagree with it.
0.116666666666667	7	system worked well for them," she said in reference to the Buckeys.
0	7	I just hope to God that years from now we don't hear about Ray Buckey molesting children."
0	7	Los Angeles County Dist.
0.145833333333333	7	Atty. Ira Reiner blamed the criminal justice system for the length of the trial, and said he backs two state court-reform initiatives.
0	7	much time and too much money has gone into this case.
0	7	This is insane.
0	7	The very idea a case can go to trial for 2 1/2 years and there can be a rational result is preposterous.
0.125	7	The McMartin case is the very worst example that we have, period.
0	7	But it does not stand alone."
0.125	7	Defense attorneys Dean Gits and Danny Davis were beaming after the verdict announcement.
0.0945945945945946	7	feel great," Gits said, indicating he had found hope that the decision would go the defense way last week when the jury informed the judge it was reaching deadlock on a conspiracy count.
0	7	With the acquittal, Pounders freed more than $3 million worth of property that had been posted by Buckey supporters as bail last year so that he could be released after five years in jail.
0	7	Buckey's mother had been free on a smaller bail amount earlier after spending nearly two years in jail.
0.0921052631578947	7	The McMartin case which included allegations not only of rape, sodomy, oral copulation, and other sex crimes, but also of pornographic photography sessions, games," field trips away from the school for illicit purposes, animal mutilation, threats and satanic-like ritual and sacrifice began in the fall of 1983.
0	7	The mother of a 2 1/2-year-old complained to Manhattan Beach police that her son had been sodomized by Ray," and subsequent physical examinations indicated he had been sexually abused.
0.0364583333333333	7	Buckey was arrested in September of that year, but was released as the investigation continued and widened to include six other teachers at the Manhattan Beach nursery school, among them his grandmother, dozens of suspects," and eight other South Bay nursery schools.
0	7	The Manhattan Beach Police Department sent a form letter to hundreds of McMartin school parents asking for information, and a wave of hysteria swept through the affluent beach town.
0	7	Many parents took their youngsters to Children's Institute International, a Los Angeles child-abuse diagnostic and treatment center, for evaluation; the majority were told that their children had been victimized.
0.357954545454545	7	In March, 1984, Ray Buckey was rearrested, along with his sister, Peggy Ann Buckey, his mother, Peggy McMartin Buckey, his grandmother, Virginia McMartin, and teachers Betty Raidor, Babette Spitler and Mary Ann Jackson.
0	7	A county grand jury had indicted them on 115 counts; that indictment was superseded in May by a criminal complaint charging them with 208 counts involving 41 children.
0.125	7	The case was hastily filed, and it was flawed from the beginning.
0	7	Atty. Robert Philibosian, running for reelection, and the media, which caught wind of the investigation, were pressing for action.
0.0889830508474576	7	Children's Institute International, deluged with concerned parents, enlisted untrained therapists to assess the children, resulting in videotaped interviews filled with leading and suggestive questions that would later prove embarrassing to the prosecution and provide the defense with grounds for claiming that the alleged victims had been programmed to believe that they had been molested.
0	7	Hundreds of South Bay children had fallen victim to a nationwide conspiracy and pornography ring, it was alleged, and an angry mob spray-painted Must Die" on the walls of the nursery school and began digging up an adjacent vacant lot in search of animal remains.
0.0372340425531915	7	The 18-month preliminary hearing, which began in the fall of 1984, was marked by frequent shouting matches between three prosecutors, nine defense attorneys and Municipal Judge Aviva Bobb, and lengthy questioning of child witnesses that lasted in one instance for 16 days.
0	7	Los Angeles was riveted by the daily images of youngsters clambering atop a booster chair in their Sunday best to face their alleged molesters.
0	7	They munched cookies, swigged root beer, and sometimes sobbed as they told of their experiences at McMartin.
0	7	Perhaps the most poignant moment came when an 8-year-old girl told in a wispy voice of having been raped, photographed, tied up and placed in a dark closet by her teachers five years earlier.
0.0546875	7	In the end, Bobb ordered all seven defendants to stand trial on 135 charges, telling each, court believes there is sufficient cause to believe you are guilty."
0.0921052631578947	7	The remaining charges had been dropped after only 14 of the scheduled child witnesses came forward to testify.
0.0795454545454546	7	One child was allowed to testify by closed-circuit television, under a new state law passed especially for the McMartin case.
0.17156862745098	7	But a week later, in January, 1986, the new district attorney, Ira Reiner, who had inherited the case from Philibosian, dropped charges against five of the seven defendants, citing weak evidence" and deciding to proceed only against Ray Buckey and his mother.
0	7	The trial itself began with jury selection in April, 1987.
0.35	7	Testimony began in July.
0	7	The scope of the trial was narrowed again when several parents decided not to allow their children to testify.
0	7	Eventually nine of 11 named victims took the witness stand, all sticking to their earlier accounts, but for minor inconsistencies.
0.0564516129032258	7	Toddlers at the time of their alleged abuse and now nearing adolescence, they described in graphic detail the abuses they say they suffered at the hands of the Buckeys.
0	7	Their testimony was often raw and unsettling.
0.125	7	The children's allegations were supported by medical evidence testified to by physicians.
0.21875	7	But both Buckey and his mother also took the stand and staunchly maintained their innocence.
0.152173913043478	7	And fellow teachers, including former defendants, testified that no improprieties in the small school could have occurred without their knowledge.
0.0853658536585366	7	The prosecution sought to show that the children repeatedly had been abused sexually, but silenced for years by threats, and also that their child-like efforts to tell their parents that something was wrong had been ignored or misinterpreted.
0.120689655172414	7	The defense contended that nothing untoward happened at the school, but that the children were programmed by therapists to believe that something bad had happened to them.
0	7	It claimed that their stories defied common sense and that the medical evidence was unreliable and perhaps fabricated.
0	7	The 6-year-long case was marked by twists and turns and tragedies, prompting the judge to comment that it had everyone it had touched.
0	7	Day after day, it was punctuated with the unexpected and bizarre:
0	7	Ailing family matriarch Virginia McMartin, now 82, wrote poetry, conducted colorful hallway interviews and tested the judge's patience with such outbursts as, awful court.
0	7	These awful people.

0.128048780487805	8	Though the historic McMartin Pre-School criminal trial finally has ended in acquittals, a host of civil lawsuits generated by the Manhattan Beach molestation case conceivably could keep the issue alive in the courts for decades, legal experts say.

0.0795454545454546	8	These include a federal civil rights suit filed Friday by Peggy McMartin Buckey against her accusers and others; a lawsuit filed by former defendants against a television station and reporter and suits the pre-school owners have filed against their liability insurance carriers.
0.152173913043478	8	Also, Ray Buckey might file a federal suit similar to that of his mother, said his attorney, Scott Bernstein.
0.12962962962963	8	And an attorney representing several parents of McMartin attendees said they might now refile lawsuits against the pre-school for emotional distress allegedly suffered by the children.
0.0673076923076923	8	convinced this case will never end," Eli Gauna, who represents Babette Spitler, a former teacher at the school, said wearily.
0	8	will always be there, until everyone who was ever involved gets to old age or dies."
0.291666666666667	8	In the criminal case the longest and costliest criminal proceeding in U.S. history Ray Buckey, 31, and his mother Peggy McMartin Buckey, 63, were acquitted Thursday of 52 counts of molestation involving 11 youngsters who attended the family nursery school in Manhattan Beach.
0.308823529411765	8	The jury deadlocked on 13 remaining counts, and a mistrial was declared on those allegations.
0.205882352941176	8	A decision is expected next week over whether those charges will be refiled against Ray Buckey.
0.0833333333333333	8	The verdict was a high mark, but not the final moment, in a lengthy and entangled legal saga.
0.134615384615385	8	The criminal case began in March, 1984, when seven McMartin teachers were indicted by a county grand jury on 115 counts of molestation.
0	8	The indictment was superseded by a criminal complaint of 208 counts of molestation and conspiracy.
0	8	After an 18-month preliminary hearing, all seven were ordered to stand trial.
0.145833333333333	8	Defendants included Buckey; his mother; his grandmother, Virginia McMartin, who was the school founder; his sister Peggy Ann Buckey; and teachers Spitler, Betty Raidor and Mary Ann Jackson.
0	8	But a week after the hearing ended, Dist.
0.116666666666667	8	Atty. Ira Reiner dropped charges against the latter five defendants citing weak evidence."
0.102941176470588	8	Even before the criminal case went to trial, civil litigation already was in the works.
0.05	8	In 1984, a handful of lawsuits were filed by 22 families seeking monetary damages against the school for medical bills, cost of psychiatric therapy and emotional distress arising from the alleged molestations.
0.0760869565217391	8	But those lawsuits later were withdrawn to prevent the children's psychiatric histories from being introduced as evidence in the criminal case.
0	8	Greg Mooney, an attorney who represented some of the plaintiffs, explained that during the criminal preliminary hearing, defense attorneys had sought psychiatric records of the alleged victims.
0.053030303030303	8	Defense attorneys argued that they should be entitled to the records because the children had waived their patient-therapist confidentiality by filing civil suits in which their psychiatric histories would be at issue.
0.0875	8	civil suits were withdrawn so they would not become an issue in the criminal case," Mooney said.
0	8	He said Friday, however, that the civil lawsuits can now be refiled.
0	8	Mooney said a decision on whether to refile will be made only after authorities decide what to do with the 13 remaining criminal counts.
0	8	impossible to predict how many parents will want to sue," Mooney said.
0	8	between a handful and a bushelful."
0.116666666666667	8	Any new suits would have to be filed only on behalf of the children.
0	8	The parents could not seek damages on their own, because the one-year statute of limitations the deadline in which a lawsuit can be filed has passed.
0	8	Under state law, children who allege abuse have until they are 19 years old to file.
0.116666666666667	8	Many of the children who attended McMartin are now entering their early teens, but the youngest of those who attended the school then is now 8 years old.
0.0760869565217391	8	Legal experts, however, say some courts have held that child abuse victims can file at any time in their life.
0	8	In the so-called delayed-discovery theory, a statute of limitations does not take effect until the victim actually becomes aware of molestation, and some victims might suppress memories of such attacks for years.
0.0546875	8	a possibility that hangs over the former defendants," said attorney Gauna, noting a recent landmark California court decision that set aside the statute of limitations for certain victims.
0.0729166666666667	8	Mooney said he knows of families that, seeking legal advantage, waited for the criminal trial to end before contemplating civil action.
0.152173913043478	8	He explained that some families believed they might have a better advantage in civil court rather than in a criminal case: the burden of proof in civil litigation is the preponderance of the evidence, not reasonable doubt, as in a criminal trial.
0.276315789473684	8	Also, in a civil case, only nine of the 12 jurors must agree on a verdict.
0	8	Criminal convictions require unanimous juries.
0	8	Whether the families would be willing to tackle more years of legal proceedings is yet to be seen.
0.159090909090909	8	And some families question whether the McMartin defendants' insurance carriers would pay out to plaintiffs who successfully sued the school.
0	8	hasn't been any decisions yet.
0	8	The parents need a little space between the events of this week and deciding what they will do," Mooney said.
0	8	is some sentiment that says, just put this behind us.'
0	8	But there is also sentiment among others that maybe they should pick up the civil case where the criminal case left off.
0.116666666666667	8	heard the jurors when they said they believed that things happened to the children.
0	8	They think maybe since the criminal jury couldn't get the higher standard of proof, a civil jury would bring about a resolution."
0	8	Said one McMartin attendee's parent, who asked not to be identified: might be tempted to file a civil suit to provide a trust fund for my child.
0	8	But there apparently isn't any money there to be had."
0	8	The only other reasons for filing such a suit, the parent added, would be work through a lot of emotional things, and we have already done that by participating in the criminal proceedings."
0	8	Gauna, Spitler's attorney, said the litigation will go on because a half-dozen to a dozen hard-line parents won't let it go away.
0	8	They will live this case until the day they die."
0	8	Meanwhile, already wending its way through court is a lawsuit filed by the early defendants.
0.134615384615385	8	Peggy Ann Buckey, Virginia McMartin, Spitler and Raidor are suing the television station, the reporter who broke the McMartin story and others.
0	8	The suit alleges that the station and reporter, Wayne Satz, were rather than reporting the news."
0.0853658536585366	8	A lower court held that the station, KABC, was protected from the action on constitutional grounds, but a state appellate court ruled the case should proceed to trial, and the state Supreme Court upheld that decision.
0.116666666666667	8	The case, now in the early pretrial stages, is being watched closely, because it could set precedent in the field of press law, experts said.
0	8	Another suit pits former McMartin defendants and the pre-school against their liability insurance carriers.
0.0875	8	The McMartin side alleges that the insurance carriers were required by the policy to pay for their attorney bills.
0.0760869565217391	8	While the insurers have paid a portion of the defense costs, they contend the defendants should have used only one attorney.
0.0875	8	However, the defendants are arguing that because of possible conflicts of interest, each needed their own counsel.
0.109375	8	One of the former defendants, preschool teacher Maryann Jackson, settled out of court.
0	8	As it becomes apparent that McMartin cases will stretch out for years to come, parents and the former criminal defendants alike are trying to resign themselves to the inevitability that the matter may be one they can never leave behind.
0.109375	8	Soon, some of the children will be able to make their own legal decisions.
0	8	Noted one parent: really not our decision as parents anymore.
0	8	These children will soon be adults."
0	9	Geraldo Rivera was interviewing Peggy Ann Buckey on TV.
0	9	Abby Mann watched, listened and saw the makings of a movie.
0.304347826086957	9	Prosecutors had just dropped charges of child molestation against Buckey, one of the original seven defendants in the McMartin Pre-School case.
0.378378378378378	9	In that 1986 interview, Peggy Buckey was eloquent" in arguing that charges against her brother, Ray, and mother, Peggy McMartin Buckey, should be dropped as well, Mann recalled Friday.
0	9	Mann, an Oscar- and Emmy-winning screenwriter and producer, recognized a theme he had tapped before: the hysteria of a witch hunt.
0.0760869565217391	9	Soon, Mann became a controversial figure in the case itself but he got the inside track on movie and book deals.
0.106060606060606	9	And Thursday's not-guilty verdicts in Ray and Peggy McMartin Buckey's trial gave Mann the happy ending he was hoping for happy, at least, from his point of view.
0.0388888888888889	9	But Mann and his wife, Myra, who have an 800-page manuscript in the works for Random House and say they are close to finishing a screenplay, aren't expected to monopolize the telling of the 6-year-old McMartin case or the perspective.
0	9	At least two other books are planned, and at least one prominent television movie producer besides Mann says he is developing a McMartin project.
0	9	That producer, who requested anonymity, said he is certain other producers are considering projects as well.

0	9	producer chases down participants, gets rights and then it's an easy sale to networks."
0	9	Not that easy, network executives say.
0	9	Unlike the hottest true-life property of the moment the Stuart murder case in Boston, which has CBS and The Fries Co. racing to produce the first docudrama McMartin creates some tricky legal and moral problems.
0.175	9	The jury's deadlock on 13 counts creates an ambiguity: Is Ray Buckey a villain or a victim?
0	9	of the three networks would touch Ray Buckey's story," predicted Steven White, an independent producer who used to be a movie executive for both NBC and ABC.

0	9	Is it a story of justice done or justice denied?
0	9	And it's real unclear at the moment what the answer to that question is.
0	9	Unlike a documentary, it's hard to take an ambiguous position in a docudrama."
0	9	Producers think network qualms can be overcome, however.
0	9	One pointed out that the Billionaire Boys Club docudrama was broadcast before all the trials regarding the slayings were over.
0	9	are no rules," the producer said.
0.145833333333333	9	Hollywood's role in the McMartin case came to prominence early.
0.0875	9	Not long after the first allegations of child molestation six years ago, several producers pitched projects to networks.
0	9	Though no explicit McMartin story was produced, child abuse and molestation was a recurring subject.
0	9	One CBS fictional movie last year You Know the Muffin Man?"
0	9	featured a preschool and satanic child molesters.
0	9	Mann, whose writing credits include the Academy Award-winning at Nuremberg" in 1961, won an Emmy for Marcus-Nelson Murders," a three-hour drama based on a true case in which a black youth was wrongly convicted of the killings of two white women.
0	9	The prosecutors, the media and the community seemed blinded by hysteria, Mann said.
0.194444444444444	9	Gaining the confidence of the McMartin defendants, the Manns were ultimately hired as by the defense.
0.120689655172414	9	That and their earlier alliance with former prosecutor Glenn Stevens sparked charges from parents of alleged child molestation victims of a conspiracy to obstruct justice for monetary gain.
0.0625	9	Stevens, who said he had asked to be removed from the McMartin trial team in October, 1985, said he and Mann agreed in March, 1986, to produce a book and movie about the case with the understanding that their discussions would become public after the trial and appeals were over.
0.0833333333333333	9	But in late 1986, Mann released interviews with Stevens in which Stevens said he doubted the defendants' guilt.
0	9	Mann said his attorneys had advised him that to withhold them would be an obstruction of justice.
0	9	Outraged parents suggested the real aim was a not-guilty verdict, which would improve the value of Mann's movie deal.
0	9	But Stevens and the Manns have said their ambition from the start has been to get the truth out.
0	9	At least two other perspectives may reach the bookstores.
0	9	Ray Buckey's lawyer, Danny Davis, and writer Gordon Dillow, former columnist for the defunct Los Angeles Herald Examiner, have a book proposal that is being pitched to a variety of publishers.
0.145833333333333	9	Times staff writer Lois Timnick, who covered the case from its early stages through the trial, also is planning a book.
0	9	Mann said his script isn't a courtroom drama.
0	9	not a trial movie.
0	9	It's what happens to human beings.
0	9	I intend to be fair to the parents.
0	9	I don't mean to be vindicative. For the most part, I have great sympathy for the parents."
0.128048780487805	10	A Hermosa Beach minister who for years has tried in vain to quell rumors tying his church to the McMartin Pre-School scandal announced Sunday that the stress" of fallout from the case has forced him to seek disability retirement.
0	10	The Rev. John D. Eales of St. Cross Episcopal Church where McMartin pupils claimed they had been forced to take part in satanic rituals told the congregation during his sermon that, much prayer and consultation," he realized his health could not withstand the continuing harassment and vandalization the church has borne as a result of the unsubstantiated claims.
0.544444444444445	10	The McMartin case, which prompted the longest and most expensive criminal trial in U.S. history, ended Thursday with the acquittal of defendants Ray Buckey and Peggy McMartin Buckey on a total of 52 counts of child molestation at the Manhattan Beach school.
0.21875	10	The jurors deadlocked on 13 other counts.
0.0972222222222222	10	Nonetheless, the case continues to divide and haunt the South Bay communities where it was centered.
0.1875	10	St. Cross was never named as a defendant in the case and neither Eales nor any other official of the venerable seaside church was ever formally charged.
0	10	But since 1985, the church has struggled to shake a McMartin pupil's allegation during the preliminary hearing that, six years earlier, he and other students had been forced to witness animal sacrifices and satanic rituals at the altar of St. Cross.
0	10	When the then-10-year-old boy's allegation was reported in the local media, other children claimed that they too had been abused at the church.
0	10	Though investigators using sophisticated equipment checked the altar and found no trace of blood, attendance dropped drastically at the church and the church-run preschool, which closed soon afterward.
0.053030303030303	10	The allegations never died, despite the passage of time and the announcement by Los Angeles County sheriff's investigators that they had found no evidence to support the children's claims.
0.106060606060606	10	Periodically over the years, Eales said, he would receive threatening phone calls at the church and rectory, and the harassment increased as the McMartin case began to wind down.
0	10	Twice in December, the church and rectory were pelted with bottles and rotten eggs.
0	10	In a note left in the rectory driveway after the second attack, the vandals, who identified themselves as Beach Cities' Conscience," warned that is simply no place for Satan worship in this town."
0	10	The harassment was exacerbated by the arrest shortly after Christmas of a youth counselor at the church, who was charged with molesting two teen-age boys he had met through his work at St. Cross.
0.0448717948717949	10	The counselor, it turned out, was a convicted child molester who had been brought into the fold about a year and a half earlier by an assistant pastor who was hired after the McMartin case broke.
0.0583333333333333	10	Then, just days after that assistant pastor resigned, the McMartin verdict came down, and, according to several church members, the anonymous phone calls returned.
0	10	kind of like a violin string you can only tighten it so far and then it snaps," Eales said Sunday.
0	10	Though at 61 Eales has 11 more years until the diocese would mandate his retirement, he said his doctors told him that kind of stress you have been under kills."
0	10	Because of that, he said, he plans to extend a medical leave already scheduled to allow for some minor surgery next week and retire a year short of the 10-year tenure that was his goal when he came to St. Cross.
0	10	His decision shocked and saddened parishioners, who credited Eales with shepherding the church through difficult times.
0	10	Said Ron Russell, a 16-year member of the congregation:
0	10	brought a good, strong man in here, and well, this has ruined him."

0	1	Port workers occupied the docks in Szezecin, about 250 miles northwest of Warsaw, and set up a 15-member strike committee, said Jan Kostecki, a leader of the independent union federation.
0	1	A local prosecutor immediately declared the strike illegal, Solidarity officials said.
0	1	Andrzej Andrzejczak, head of the Morcinek mine strike committee, said: We support all of the demands of the July Manifesto mine workers.
0.0634920634920635	1	The mine is about 12 miles south of July Manifesto, where strikers were demanding legalization of the outlawed independent labor federation, pay raises and reinstatement of workers fired for trade union activites.
0	1	Police ringing July Manifesto, one of Poland's largest coal mines, today turned away area residents who tried to bring food to the strikers.
0	1	Andrzejczak said the Morcinek miners broke off talks with management when they were refused access to loudspeakers and contact with the strikers at July Manifesto.
0	1	He said miners erected a large Polish flag atop the administration building and were blocking the complex's main entrance.
0	1	It was not immediately known how many workers were involved.
0	1	The second strike came as Solidarity strike committee members met with management and representatives of the Industry Ministry at the July Manifesto colliery.

0.0634920634920635	1	The strike committee issued a communique today saying the workers would not end their stoppage until their demands are met and charged: The mine management is trying to end the strike by hunger.
0	1	Police surrounded the mine after workers put down their tools on Tuesday.
0	1	Witnesses said about 600 officers were outside and about 3,000 strikers inside.
0	1	The strikes mark the eighth anniversary of the birth of the Solidarity, which Communist authorities crushed in a 1981 military crackdown.
0	1	Miners leaving July Manifesto this morning said wage demands were based on hardships caused by Poland's worsening economy, including 60 percent inflation.
0	1	The economy is in ruins, one told The Associated Press.
0	1	Miners cannot live on their salaries because of recent price hikes.
0	1	Miners earn nearly twice the average national salary and receive extra benefits because of the vital role they play in the economy.
0.222222222222222	1	Poland is the world's fourth largest exporter of coal, and coal is the nation's leading export.
0	1	July Manifesto, a hotbed of labor activism during the strike wave that spawned Solidarity, is one of five coal mines in the region.

0	1	The state-run PAP news agency, in a dispatch late Tuesday, said the strike was illegal.
0	1	PAP said the miners were warned that they may be held responsible for their illegal actions.

0	1	The pact also won work-free weekends.
0	1	Solidarity leaders said the strike began Tuesday when overnight shift workers refused to take up their tools.
0	1	They were joined by workers arriving for the morning shift, Kuron said.

0	1	Solidarity spokesmen said workers at the nearby Borynia mine staged a brief sympathy rally but went back to work Tuesday afternoon.
0	1	Also Tuesday, security officials briefly detained 10 Solidarity activists at the Rudna copper mine near the city of Wroclaw in lower Silesia.
0	1	That mine has also been the scene of unrest in recent months, where workers have demanded improved safety conditions.
0.12012012012012	1	Five strikes in Poland from April 25 to May 10, and brief stoppages or strike threats in 25 more work places, constituted the worst labor unrest in the country since the 1981 martial-law crackdown.

0.0516795865633075	2	One United Mine Workers representative said today that the Indiana walkout was prompted by Thursday night's telecast of CBS' 48 Hours, which focused on the Pittston strike, in which 1,600 miners have been off the job since April.
0	2	Pittston dropped out of the Bituminous Coal Operators Association to negotiate with the union independently, and the two sides have failed to reach an agreement despite 16 months of negotiations.
0	2	UMW officials gave conflicting indications of whether they are responsible for the wildcat strike.
0	2	Some said they are asking union members to return to work, but Tommy Buchanan, international executive board member in UMW District 20 in Birmingham, Ala., said today the final decision on whether 5,000 Alabama miners will join the strike will be with union President Richard Trumka.
0	2	It might be two days.
0	2	It might be a week.
0	2	It will start whenever it comes down from the union president, Buchanan said.
0	2	Union spokesman Joe Corcoran was not in his office and has not returned phone calls this week.
0	2	The head of the coal industry bargaining unit said he had no plans to confer with the Pittston on the wildcat strikes.
0	2	I would no more try to tell someone else how to run their company than I would expect someone else to try to tell me how to run my company, said Robert H. Quenon, president of Peabody Holding Co., the nation's largest coal producer, and chairman of the Bituminous Coal Operators Association.
0	2	Quenon flew to Charleston from St. Louis on Thursday to meet with reporters and express Peabody's and the association's concerns about the walkout.
0	2	An estimated 2,300 United Mine Workers members stayed away from their jobs today in Pennsylvania.
0.0716845878136201	2	Most worked for Rochester Pittsburgh Coal Co. operations in central Pennsylvania, where 1,600 miners failed to report for work at midnight Thursday, said company spokesman Hank Waneck said.
0	2	About 290 miners at Peabody's Camp No. 1 mine in Morganfield, Ky., didn't report for work today, said company spokesman Tom Clarke.
0.123456790123457	2	At least 270 miners were off the job at two mines in Indiana today, spokesmen said.
0	2	Mark Arnold, a spokesman for UMW District 11 in Terre Haute, attributed the action to the CBS show.
0	2	When the miners saw that last night, that kind of set them off to where they decided to walk out, he said.
0.296296296296296	2	About one-third of West Virginia's 24,000 miners were reported off the job today.
0.101010101010101	2	Some 600 miners in Wise County, Va., who walked out earlier in the week returned to work this morning.
0.0823045267489712	2	The coal companies contend the walkouts at companies other than Pittston violate a no-strike clause in the 1988 national contract the union signed with the association.
0	2	Pittston did not take part in that agreement.
0	2	Union officials have not returned phone calls this week, but in the past they have said they have not authorized the walkout.
0	2	I think the union leadership ought to exercise its leadership role and do what they can to lead the miners back to work, Quenon said.
0	2	That's why we have a union.
0	2	That's why we have an agreement with the union to set out the terms and conditions under which we will have labor to run our coal mines.
0	2	And we expect that to be honored.
0.134680134680135	3	President Mikhail S. Gorbachev said today that thousands of striking coal miners and other workers are urging railway employees to join the work stoppage and that the unrest threatens his economic reforms.

0.269360269360269	3	Saunin, from the Donetsk region of the Ukraine, the country's top coal region, said the number of striking mines there increased from 20 on Tuesday to 58 today.
0	3	Now there are reports of calls to railroad workers to join the strike as of Aug. 1, Gorbachev said during the parliamentary session, which was broadcast on television and radio.
0	3	Such a development of events poses a threat to the implementation of plans projected by the policy of perestroika, he said, referring to his efforts to restructure the economy.
0.158730158730159	3	Miners began walking out July 11 in Siberia's Kuznetsk Basin coal region.
0	3	Workers in other industries in the region soon followed.
0.444444444444444	3	On Saturday, miners in the Donetsk coal basin began walking off the job.
1	3	The miners are demanding more local control over their industry as well as higher wages and better living conditions.
0.130718954248366	3	Gorbachev said he and Premier Nikolai I. Ryzhkov sent a telegram to miners in the Ukraine assuring them that any concessions granted to Siberian miners would apply to other mining regions as well.
0	3	He blamed some of the miners' discontent on anti-socialist elements but said he understood their basic demands.
0	3	Government negotiations with strike committees have resolved most of the miners' demands, including those on pensions and overtime, but some longer-term questions will take up to a month to settle, and the miners are refusing any delay, he said.
0.296296296296296	3	Central authorities have so far balked at granting miners more control over their industry.
0.0555555555555556	3	If the strike spreads to other sectors of the economy, We may have to take such extreme measures that it will hurt what we've been doing, Gorbachev said, without specifying what steps he would take.
0	3	He said the lost coal production could not be recovered by increasing the mines' output because they already work at full capacity.
0	3	Recent reports have put the total number of strikers in the Donetsk and Kuznetsk regions at more than 112,000, but the number appeared to be rising.
0	3	Because of disrupted coal deliveries, the strike threatened a catastrophe at metallurgical and electrical power plants, Tass said.
0.0694444444444444	3	The Politburo sent to Kuznetsk Nikolai N. Slyunkov, a member of the ruling Communist Party body who worked several years in the tractor-building industry and has spoken about labor discipline.

0.355555555555556	3	Tass carried a report Tuesday denying that the Soviet Union's third major coal region, Karaganda in Kazakhstan, also was on strike.
0	3	A proposed law on ending strikes and other labor conflicts is being rushed through the Supreme Soviet legislature, Tass said.
0	3	A spokesman for the strike committee in Prokopyevsk, Valery Legachev, said Tuesday that Slyunkov promised to increase the area's regular food supplies by 20 to 30 percent, as well as soap and washing powder.
0	3	Izvestia, the government newspaper, reported Tuesday that Slyunkov promised higher pay for night work, longer vacations and a doubling of the wholesale price of coal to pay for the benefits.
0	3	The strikes are believed to be the nation's worst since the 1920s, when the country was gripped in revolution, civil war and a power struggle.
0	3	Records from that period are sketchy, but fighting was widespread and industrial production was severely disrupted.
0.211640211640212	3	Until Gorbachev came to power in 1985, the official media did not report job actions in the Soviet Union.
0	3	Underground reports described strikes that were of much shorter and not as widespread as those in Kuznetsk and Donetsk.

0	4	In Karaganda, strikers said they walked out to protest incomplete news accounts of miners' demands in the Kuznetsk strikes, according to Tass.
0	4	President Mikhail S. Gorbachev said Wednesday the strikes could imperil his reforms and that there were reports of railway workers being urged to strike.
0	4	He said that if labor trouble spreads, We may have to take such extreme measures that it will hurt what we've been doing to overhaul the economy through greater attention to free-market mechanisms.
0	4	He did not elaborate.

0	4	In a report from the Donetsk city of Yenakiyevo, television said steel and coke-chemical plants were on the verge of a stoppage for lack of coal.
0	4	Earlier reports in the official press had said operations at steel and power plants were affected by short supplies of coal and coke.
0	4	Gorbachev told the national legislature Wednesday that the strikes had deprived the nation of more than 1 million tons of coal.
0	4	The government has agreed to most miner demands, including those on pensions and overtime, Gorbachev said.
0	4	But he said that settling some longer-term issues would take up to a month.
0	4	Tass outlined a concessions package that includes bonus pay to night shifts and for men using jackhammers.
0	4	Strikers also have complained about poor housing and shortages of consumer goods and food, and the government has made general pledges of improvements in those areas.
0.196078431372549	5	Coal miners in Siberia ended their strike today after exacting promises of better food, housing and working conditions, but the wave of unrest they launched continued in other key coal regions.

0.14336917562724	5	Gorbachev has expressed sympathy for the strikers and placed much of the blame for the miners' deteriorating working and living conditions on leaders of the officially sanctioned trade unions.
0	5	Still, he and other Communist leaders have warned that if the strikes don't end quickly, coal shortages will shut down much of the country's industry.
0	5	On Wednesday, the Kuznetsk strike committee and members of a high-level government commission signed an agreement meeting many demands.
0.116959064327485	5	The workers were promised higher wages, increased deliveries of meat, sugar, soap, clothes, furniture and other consumer goods, more housing construction and most important a greater voice in running their industry.
0.0823045267489712	5	It's a victory over the system that we've had in the Soviet Union for the last 70 years, a system in which we work hard but get little in return, said Pyotr A. Menayev, an engineer at the Taldinski Severny open pit mine on the outskirts of Prokopyevsk.

0	5	The Coal Mining Ministry will continue to run the mines, but the miners will have a much greater say setting production levels and allocating the profits, he said.

0	7	The strike continued at these mines on 28 June.
0	7	Some of the miners at the Karl Marx, Zhovten," Profinter," and pits joined the strike.
0	7	A total of 1,200 of the association's 2,248 workers are on strike.

0.103359173126615	8	The strike at KGHM in Lubin, western Poland, where mining unions representing some 40,0000 workers have been demanding a 30 per cent wage increase, came despite a management offer at the weekend to increase wages by 20 per cent.
0.0854700854700855	8	Further increases could only come if the government eased prohibitive wage control taxes, thus providing a powerful precedent for wage demands by other groups.
0.0966183574879227	8	Meanwhile coal mining unions are also demanding wage increases as well as a clear restructuring strategy for their industry after last week's scattered stoppages in some 15 of Poland's 71 pits wrung promises of wage rises that cash strapped managements can ill afford.
0	8	In contrast to the copper industry, which continues to show a profit, coal mining is running at a loss with subsidies stopped in March as the government moved to control the budget deficit.
0.0740740740740741	8	The industry is experiencing a coal glut with pit head, power station and export stocks amounting to some 12m tonnes, the equivalent of a month's output.
0	8	This has led to temporary lay-offs, which have hit miners' incomes and led to the present bout of unrest.
0	8	Polish mines produced 69.7m tonnes of coal in the first half of the year or 1.5 per cent less than in the same period last year.
0	8	Meanwhile KGHM produced 197,000 tonnes of refined copper in the same period or 3.9 per cent more than in the first half of 1991.
0.202020202020202	9	COALMINERS from Romania's Jiu Valley, who spearheaded violent anti-reform rampages through Bucharest in 1990 and 1991, are once again out on strike, pressing the government for higher wages.
0	9	But so far the government, unlike its predecessors, has not caved in.
0	9	It has instead begun legal action to have the strike, which today entered its second week, declared illegal.
0	9	The miners' position seems untenable.
0	9	Romanians appear solidly opposed to the strike, angered by the miners' demands for an average wage of the equivalent of Dollars 290 a month.
0	9	Most workers earn less than Dollars 80.
0.105820105820106	9	Workers in the same trade union confederation as the miners have ignored appeals by their leaders to strike in solidarity.
0	9	The Ministry of Industry argues that the 6m tonnes of pit coal produced each year in the Jiu Valley's 13 mines is not a vital source of energy.
0	9	The region's coal supplies two nearby power stations but these plants, which together account for only 4 per cent of the country's electricity capacity, could also be run using lignite and gas.
0	9	The ministry further argues that the miners are in danger of pricing their coal out of the market.
0	9	According to the ministry, if the miners' pay demands were met, the cost of their coal would double.
0	9	Even at present prices, Ukrainian coal is being imported to the Romanian market.
0	9	The strike seems motivated by a number of factors.
0.0888888888888889	9	The rank and file have come out because they want more money to compensate for the difficult conditions in which they live and work.
0.0716845878136201	9	They are also following the call of their charismatic leader, Mr Miron Cosma, the man who led them on protests to Bucharest and secured their earlier wage increases.
0.0766283524904215	9	Mr Cosma's motive for calling the strike for which, surprisingly, he has the support of RAH, the state-owned coal mining company are less obvious.
0.0888888888888889	9	The ministries of industry and finance are conducting investigations into charges of fraud and embezzlement by Mr Cosma and several senior RAH company officials.
0	9	The company's chief accountant and budget director have already been fired, following earlier investigations.
0	9	Ministry of Industry officials argue the strike could be an attempt to divert attention from the investigations.
0	9	Mr Cosma, however, appears confident.
0	9	One of his bargaining tools is the threat, albeit veiled, of fresh violence.
0	9	In response to the question as to whether he intends to lead his men, who appear to support him whole-heartedly, to Bucharest again, he says: miners, anything is possible.'
0	9	But he is also making political threats.
0	9	In recent months, Mr Cosma has claimed he has evidence that senior government officials, including President Ion Iliescu, called miners to Bucharest as part of plans to consolidate their own power.
0	9	Mr Cosma appears increasingly willing to talk if his demands are not met.
0	9	It remains to be seen whether those involved in the incidents of 1990 and 1991 now feel confident enough to ignore him.
0.398860398860399	10	A one-day strike by coal miners in Kazakhstan and the Ukraine has grown into a nationwide walkout involving up to 100,000 miners demanding President Mikhail Gorbachev surrender power to the restive republics, a union leader said Friday.
0	10	government doesn't want to negotiate with us.
0	10	They understand that we're not like the phony unions they had before," said Pavel Shushpanov, chairman of the executive committee of the 5-month-old Independent Union of Miners.
0.0529100529100529	10	Most of the country's 1.2 million coal miners are still working, but output in some key regions has been halved, saddling Gorbachev with a substantial labor and fuel problem even as he struggles to revive the Soviet economy.
0	10	The strike is the new union's first major test of strength.
0.253968253968254	10	It began March 1 as a warning action in the Karaganda coal field of Kazakhstan and the Krasnoarmeisk area of the Ukraine but gradually spread to all of the country's major coal regions.
0.233918128654971	10	The strikers are seeking wage increases of at least 100 percent, better working conditions and earlier retirement.
0.164609053497942	10	They claim the government has not kept promises it made to raise miners' living standards as settlement of a nationwide coal strike in July 1989.
0	10	The 1989 strike, which involved more than 500,000 miners, made only economic demands.
0	10	This time, Shushpanov said, the miners also want three major political concessions.
0	10	First, he said, they want sovereignty" for the 15 Soviet republics.
0	10	They are unhappy with Gorbachev's proposed Union Treaty, which would leave the central government in control of the economy, defense, foreign policy and communications, he said.
0	10	Second, the union is demanding more power for Gorbachev's Federation Council, which includes the presidents of all the republics.
0	10	Finally, the union wants a on property" that would define what belongs to the government and allow private ownership of land and industry, including some mines, he said.
0.227920227920228	10	According to the state news agency Tass, the strike has spread to the Donetsk coal basin of the Ukraine, the Vorkuta and Inta regions of northern Russia, and the Kuznetsk coal basin of western Siberia.
0.479302832244009	11	The National Union of Mineworkers said an estimated 200,000 black gold and coal miners in South Africa will begin a strike Sunday night for higher wages and better working conditions, in what it said would be the largest job action ever to affect the mining industry in that nation.
0.0694444444444444	11	The strike initially would cover more than half of South Africa's gold mines and about one-fifth of its coal mines, said Cyril Ramaphosa, the union's general secretary.
0.0823045267489712	11	If workers in mines not included in current negotiations join in sympathy strikes, a total of 300,000 miners could be on strike, he said.
0.444444444444444	11	Gold and coal account for more than half of South Africa's foreign-currency earnings.
0.0600600600600601	11	The union's announcement produced little immediate reaction on South African financial markets, where analysts said a strike had been expected and probably wouldn't have much impact unless it lasted more than a month.
0	11	Mine owners reportedly have been building stockpiles for several weeks in anticipation of a strike.
0	11	Mining companies' shares rose along with the price of gold, but the metal's rise came mainly in reaction to increased tensions in the Persian Gulf.
0.277777777777778	11	The South African rand was slightly firmer.
0.0716845878136201	11	Mr. Ramaphosa said the union is demanding a 30%, across-the-board wage increase for black miners, who the union says earn an average of 225 rand a month.
0	11	The Chamber of Mines, which represents the nation's six biggest mining houses, says black miners earn about twice that much.
0.158730158730159	11	It implemented wage increases ranging from 15% to 23.4% last month.
0.12012012012012	11	Anglo American Corp., the huge South African mining house, warned against a strike, saying miners had received a good wage increase in July and wouldn't gain further raises by a job action.
0	11	But this stage it seems the strike seems inevitable," said Mr. Ramaphosa, who added that there hadn't been any negotiations with management since a strike ballot received support" during the week of July 12.
0	11	He also warned of possible confrontations with police, saying: have issued instructions to our members that if they are attacked they should defend themselves."
0.123456790123457	11	Miners' strikes in recent years have featured clashes with police, leaving dozens of people dead.
0	11	total mines that will be affected are 28 gold mines around the country and 18 collieries," the union official said.
0.0555555555555556	11	union is at the same time in dispute with a number of other companies, where strike action could take place at any time, should the various mine managements refuse to accede to our members' demands."
0.116959064327485	11	He said such other companies included De Beers Consolidated Mines Ltd., the world's largest diamond miner.
0.0966183574879227	11	In addition to the general wage increase, Mr. Ramaphosa said the union is demanding pay for black miners doing dangerous work.
0	11	The black miners also are asking for 30 days' leave each year, and a paid holiday on June 16, the anniversary of the 1976 Soweto riots.
0	11	They also want an increase in death benefits to five years from two.

0.121212121212121	0	A Soviet newspaper has painted a highly sympathetic portrait of Andrei D. Sakharov and Yelena Bonner, countering past attacks on the dissident couple once branded as traitors by the state-run media.
0.171428571428571	0	But the account in Moscow News only indirectly mentioned the nearly seven years Sakharov spent in forced internal exile for criticizing the Soviet drive into Afghanistan, indicating that topic is still too sensitive.
0.222222222222222	0	In its latest issue, the weekly devoted its entire back page to describing the home life of Sakharov, 66, the 1975 Nobel Peace Prize winner, and said the words most often heard in his seventh-floor Moscow apartment are help me.
0.324324324324324	0	Sakharov's apartment on a major thoroughfare has been a mecca for Soviets seeking his aid since he and his wife were allowed to return from exile in the closed city of Gorky in December 1986.
0.24	0	Since then, Sakharov, who was one of the creators of his nation's hydrogen bomb, has vocally supported Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev's reform campaign, but has called for the liberation of all political prisoners and more improvements in the field of human rights.
0	0	Past Soviet reports, published before Gorbachev became Soviet leader, accused Bonner of marrying Sakharov for his money and said the couple lived in oriental luxury amid scandals between spouses.
0.0454545454545455	0	Moscow News depicted the couple as living peacefully and frugally, eating cabbage, beet soup, potatoes, and other simple fare, and marveled that Sakharov, a member of the prestigious Academy of Sciences, always does the dishes himself.
0.0526315789473684	0	While Sakharov was in exile in the closed city of Gorky, the author of a book that accused him of leading a luxurious and scandal-ridden existence came to ask for an interview, Moscow News said.
0	0	Sakharov put a copy of his book in front of him and proposed that he write an apology for all the lies that were published, the paper said.
0	0	It reported that when the unidentified author refused, Sakharov said, It's too bad that duels are abolished in our times, and slapped him.
0	0	Sakharov has been quoted numerous times by Soviet media since his return from exile, but the article in Moscow News was the longest devoted to him so far.
0	0	But most of the newspaper's circulation is among foreign tourists and readers abroad, so relatively few Soviets would see the Sakharov article.
0	0	As well as appearing in Russian, Moscow News also prints editions in English, French and other languages.
0.137931034482759	1	Soviet media once branded Andrei D. Sakharov a traitor, but a Moscow weekly has now provided a sympathetic portrait of the human rights activist and his wife.
0	1	This week's issue of the newspaper Moscow News said that Sakharov long ago understood the need for change in the Soviet Union.
0.181818181818182	1	The article makes a clear attempt to refute some of the past charges leveled at Sakharov and his wife, fellow dissident Yelena Bonner, by Soviet officials and the state-controlled media.
0.4	1	Moscow News also pointedly notes that the 1975 Nobel Peace Prize winner has praised Mikhail S. Gorbachev's campaign for social and economic reform.

0	1	It said their two-room home was always filled with people seeking Sakharov's aid, and that the words most often heard there are: Help me.
0	1	But Moscow News asked: Can he really do everything?
0.307692307692308	1	Although the full-page article was the longest on Sakharov to date in the Soviet press, it made only indirect reference to the nearly seven years he spent in exile after criticizing the Kremlin's intervention in Afghanistan.
0.444444444444444	1	Sakharov, a brilliant physicist, was allowed to return to Moscow in December 1986 from his forced residence in the closed city of Gorky, where he was banished without trial in January 1980.
0.121212121212121	1	In effect, sometimes Sakharov bitterly jokes that he'd like to return to Gorky for a few months to be able to work alone on scientific work, Moscow News said.
0	1	Of course, concerning Gorky, that's a bitter joke.
0.181818181818182	1	Since his return to Moscow, Sakharov has been a vocal supporter of Gorbachev's program for nationwide reforms that includes the policy of glasnost, or greater openness on selected topics.
0	1	He simply believes that something helped change the thoughts of the majority into state policy, Moscow News said.
0	1	He calls perestroika an enormous event for our country and for the entire world.
0.13953488372093	1	However, Sakharov has insisted on speedier progress in improving the Soviet record on human rights, and during a Jan. 15 meeting in the Kremlin, he handed Gorbachev a list of 200 people he said were imprisoned for their views.
0	1	Moscow News noted that in 1975, in a tract titled Knowledge and the World, Sakharov set forth his views on Soviet affairs.
0	1	Those writings have not been published in the Soviet Union.
0	1	Now we can definitely see parallels between what he said then, and those ideas that we are putting forward today, Moscow News said.
0.461538461538462	1	Sakharov called for a ban on nuclear testing long before the Kremlin.
0.111111111111111	1	The human rights activist, one of the most prominent members of the dissident movement that reached its peak in the 1970s, sought openness in Soviet society years before glasnost became Communist Party policy.
0	1	Much of the Moscow News article seemed designed to undo harm caused to the Sakharovs by previous press campaigns against them.
0	1	It said one Soviet book accused the Sakharovs of living in oriental luxury and engaging in scandals between spouses.
0.0512820512820513	1	Moscow News said Sakharov was stubborn, unassuming, an undisputed member of his country's intelligentsia and a man with his own views on how to deal conscientiously with world affairs and the demands of this life.
0	1	His strong convictions even extend to his insistence that he do the dishes after meals, wrote the reporter who visited Sakharov at his apartment.
0	1	What is that, Andrei Dmitrievich, your hobby?
0	1	asked Moscow News correspondent Gennady Zhavoronkov.
0	1	Not all guests are able to wash the dishes conscientiously, Sakharov replied.
0.0526315789473684	2	The visit by human rights activist Andrei D. Sakharov to the United States has gone virtually unreported by state media, with a radio broadcast saying only he had voiced opposition to the U.S. Star Wars program.

0	4	A vote on the academy candidates is scheduled for Tuesday.
0.277777777777778	4	Sakharov was nominated from several geographic districts for a seat in the new 2,250-member Congress of People's Deputies, but he decided to refuse the nominations and fight for an Academy of Sciences seat.
0.0625	4	Under an election law approved in December, 750 seats in the legislature are reserved for the Communist Party and its affiliates and for professional, social and trade union organizations.
0	4	The other 1,500 will be filled by representatives of the 15 Soviet republics and their electoral districts.
0	4	Those in the academy who support Sakharov hope to force a new round of nominations by mustering enough support to deny all nominees a majority, said Andrei Mironov, a former political prisoner.
0	4	That would force the academy to start over and produce a new list of nominees under terms of the new election law.
0	4	Twenty-five seats were allotted to the academy, but it gave five to affiliated societies and associations.
0	4	From 121 nominees, the academy leadership chose 23 candidates for the remaining 20 seats.

0	5	A distinguished scientist and public figure, a man of honesty and sincerity has passed away, the obituary said.
0	5	Everything that Andrei Dmitrievich did was dictated by his conscience, his deep humanitarian convictions.

0	5	However, the signatures of several other Politburo members, including KGB chief Vladimir A. Kryuchkov and leading conservative Yegor K. Ligachev were missing.
0	5	Absence of their signatures could signify that the disagreed with part of the obituary.
0	5	Ligachev, interviewed by the Tass news agency on Friday, had said he disagreed with Sakharov but respected him.
0.4375	5	It was Leonid I. Brezhnev, now blamed by Gorbachev for permitting stagnation and corruption to overcome the Soviet system, who exiled Sakharov for criticizing the Soviet intervention in Afghanistan.
0.470588235294118	5	Gorbachev called Sakharov in Gorky in December 1986 and told him he could return to Moscow.
0.476190476190476	5	The Soviet leader told reporters at the Congress of People's Deputies that Sakharov's death was a great loss.
0	5	Even though the two often tangled at the Congress, Gorbachev said he respected Sakharov.

0	5	Gorbachev said he would attend Sakharov's funeral Monday afternoon in southwest Moscow's Vostryakovskoye Cemetery.
0	5	Several hundred people gathered outside Sakharov's apartment building Friday evening, holding candles and wreathing his photograph in flowers.
0	5	Memorial services were scheduled Sunday at the city's main youth center, and on Monday at the Lebedev physics institute where Sakharov worked and the Academy of Sciences, of which he was a leading member.
0.0909090909090909	5	The popular nighttime TV program Vzglad showed a brief interview with his widow, Yelena Bonner, discussing the funeral arrangements.
0.25	5	The obituary also praised Sakharov's vision as a scientist, which made him the youngest-ever member of the Academy of Sciences at age 32 and led to his inclusion in a group that developed the Soviet hydrogen bomb.
0	5	But it said that Sakharov realized the danger of the weapon he had helped create.
0.0487804878048781	5	Working on the creation of weapons of mass destruction, A.D. Sakharov understood early the danger for humanity of their wide production and testing, and stubbornly placed before the government the question of limiting such tests, it said.
0	5	But at that time his appeals were not accepted, it said.
0	5	He kept these same positions in the future.
0	6	Mourners sobbed and shook their heads in disbelief Sunday as tens of thousands viewed the flower-draped body of Andrei D. Sakharov in a huge outpouring of grief for the man described as his country's conscience.
0.315789473684211	6	Crimean Tatars and Jewish refuseniks two of the groups Sakharov helped joined rank-and-file Communists, teachers and engineers in filing past the body of the physicist, Nobel Peace Prize winner, human rights advocate and legislator.

0.0606060606060606	6	A friend of the family, speaking on condition of anonymity, said he heard estimates that 70,000 mourners viewed the body before it was returned to Sakharov's apartment at midnight.
0	6	one elderly woman cried out as she saw Sakharov's body in an open coffin, sloping to the floor of the beige marble Youth Palace in central Moscow.
0	6	She apparently meant to apologize for not recognizing his contributions earlier.
0	6	A mound of red and white carnations grew steadily at Sakharov's feet, and a spotlight was focused on a portrait showing Sakharov with his hands over his mouth, deep in thought.

0	2	I don't know what more it takes to get people to recognize this ancient technology is no longer appropriate on warships.
0.389189189189189	2	But the Navy defended the 16-inch gun, the mightiest in use on any ocean, after an explosion killed 47 sailors Wednesday aboard the battleship Iowa while a turret crew loaded gunpowder for target practice.
0	2	This gun remains the finest naval gun in the world.
0.0533333333333333	2	It was the pinnacle of gun design art, and it is still a front-line system, said Capt. Larry Seaquist, commander of the Iowa until last May.
0	2	The main criticism is that the big gun requires gunpowder packed in silk bags to fire 16-inch-diameter shells from its 62-foot-long barrel.
0.0533333333333333	2	It works like the breech-loaded guns that roared during the Civil War: A shell is placed into a barrel and then charged with gunpowder in a separate package.
0.096969696969697	2	In the Iowa's case, 660 pounds of powder six 110-pound bags is needed to fire a projectile weighing up to 2,700 pounds at a speed of 2,500 feet per second.
0	2	An electric spark ignites the powder.
0	2	The extremely flammable silk is supposed to burn away during the burst, but some red-hot debris may remain or explosive gases can build up in the barrel.
0	2	Air pressurized to 3,000 pounds per square inch can be blown into the breech to clear away debris to guard against a blowback, which happens when powder ignites before the breech is closed.
0.145454545454545	2	In newer guns, powder is packed in metal containers.
0	2	Missiles, the backbone of the modern Navy's attack capability, have integrated propellants.
0.0744186046511628	2	Capt. James Bush of the Center for Defense Information, a private think tank often critical of Pentagon policy, said the Iowa explosion could have been caused by smoldering debris, a blowback or a mishap in the handling of powder.
0	2	It wasn't unexpected.
0	2	It wasn't a surprise.
0	2	This is dangerous technology.
0	2	It's archaic, Bush said.
0.114285714285714	2	These are the only guns in the Navy that still used bagged powder.
0.218181818181818	2	The Navy said Thursday that none of the guns in the Iowa turret had been fired before the explosion took place.
0.274285714285714	2	The Navy also on Thursday placed a moratorium on firing the big guns, found only on the Iowa and its three sister battleships, the New Jersey, the Wisconsin and the Missouri.
0.139130434782609	2	In a larger sense, critics say the battleships themselves, once the mainstay of gunboat diplomacy, have outlived their purpose.
0	2	Despite 16-inch-thick armor plating, the battlewagons are vulnerable to submarine and missile attack.
0.139130434782609	2	The 20-mile range of the 16-inch guns is almost worthless in an era when missiles can be fired at much greater distances.
0	2	We can do almost anything with a missile and do it better, Bush said.
0	2	Battleships reached their heyday in World War I and were intended to fight other ships.
0.139130434782609	2	The Iowa, first launched in 1942, was the first of an entire class of U.S. battlewagons built to conquer Japan.
0.0484848484848485	2	It supported Marine amphibious landings and shelled shore targets, but the aircraft carrier emerged as the Navy's top weapon because naval battles were waged without ships ever seeing each other.
0.228571428571429	2	The Iowa also fought off Korea.
0.0727272727272727	2	The Iowa and three sister warships were ordered out of mothballs in the Reagan administration's military buildup six years ago.
0	2	They were upgraded with Tomahawk cruise missiles, 20mm guns and Harpoon missiles.
0.064	2	One of the battleships, the New Jersey, bombarded Syrian and Druze positions in Lebanon as part the U.S. peacekeeping role in 1983.
0.228571428571429	2	But the 16-inch guns often missed their targets, which the Navy blamed on unreliable powder from World War II.
0.0842105263157895	2	There was no military need to return these ships to active duty, said the CDI's LaRocque.
0	2	Their only military utility is to bombard Third World countries, and the era of gunboat diplomacy is over.

0.259459459459459	5	Sailors in whites with black arm bands lined the rails as the huge vessel docked at the Norfolk Naval Base's Pier 5 at 5:41 p.m., just one minute later than Navy officials had estimated.
0.0842105263157895	5	Twenty minutes later, families started filing aboard the ship, exchanging tearful embraces with the returning sailors.
0	5	They wanted to get here on schedule and were anxious to get home, said Capt. Steven Karalekas.
0.654545454545455	5	The explosion Wednesday flashed through the Iowa's No. 2 gun turret, which extends six decks down into the ship.
0.576	5	There were 11 survivors inside the turret, all on the lowest deck loading powder from the ship's magazines, the Navy said.
0.287179487179487	5	Two of the surviving crewmen of No. 2 turret stood on top of the fire-blackened turret as the ship pulled into the pier, with full crews on the ship's two other turrets, the Navy said.
0.256	5	The No. 2 turret was in the same position as when the explosion occurred, facing right with the left and right guns elevated.
0.266666666666667	5	The center gun, where the blast occurred, was depressed.

0.0592592592592593	5	The Navy kept the news media about 300 yards from the families, and reporters were not allowed to talk with the families or the crewmen.
0.228571428571429	5	The violence and power of the turret explosion was shown in an amateur videotape released by the Navy on Sunday.
0.133333333333333	5	The tape was made by an officer on the bridge of the Iowa who wanted to record the firing of the big guns.
0.04	5	The detonation, which appears to blast away the gasket-like rubber bloomers that seal the turret's gun slits, is followed by a jet of intense fire and thick smoke from the front and base of the gunhouse.
0.188235294117647	5	The videotape cut immediately to damage control firefighters spraying heavy streams of water onto the turret.
0	5	Throughout the Norfolk area, churches dedicated prayers Sunday morning to the families of Iowa crewmen.
0.154838709677419	5	We have lost 47 of our number in a tragic way, said Cmdr. John L. Fitzgerald, a chaplain, in a service at the Norfolk Naval Air Station.
0	5	Our faith helps us to handle what science cannot answer, the mystery of death.
0	5	A red rose, a yellow ribbon with the number 47 on it and a book containing the names of the dead were taken to the altar.
0.128	5	Fitzgerald said the Iowa tragedy and that of a recently lost Soviet submarine put political differences aside and unite the human family as one.
0.380952380952381	5	On Monday morning, President Bush will lead a memorial service in a base hangar that can accommodate 3,000 people.
0	5	The families of the victims were invited, but Navy officials said they did not know how many would attend.
0	5	None of the victims listed the Norfolk area as their hometown.
0.533333333333333	5	The explosion occurred during exercises off Puerto Rico.
0.0888888888888889	5	The Pentagon said it happened before the middle 16-inch gun of the three-gun turret had been fired.
0.0571428571428571	5	The guns, the largest on any ship at sea, use six 110-pound bags of black powder to fire a 2,700-pound projectile up to 23 miles.
0.290909090909091	5	The Navy has refused to speculate on the cause of the explosion, which damaged only the inside of the turret.
0.148837209302326	5	But Navy teams who entered the turret immediately after the blast found the No. 2 gun's breech open and undamaged, with the practice projectile that the gun was to have fired still there, The New York Times reported Sunday.
0.256	5	This indicated the explosion occurred while the powder bags were still being loaded into the gun, the Times said, citing unidentified sources.
0.32	5	Navy gunnery officers believe the explosion occurred when the bags were being transferred from a powder hoist to the gun, the newspaper said.
0.168421052631579	5	They said flame and hot gases from the blast went down the hoist to the lowest deck; if the transfer of powder to the guns had been complete, the hoist would have been sealed off.
0.110344827586207	5	The Iowa and its sister ships, the battleships Missouri, New Jersey and Wisconsin, were commissioned during World War II and mothballed after the Korean War.
0	5	They were recommissioned by the Reagan administration in the 1980s.
0.145454545454545	5	Defense Secretary Dick Cheney said Sunday that the administration plans to keep all four battleships in the fleet despite the explosion.
0	5	They are effective, they were relatively cheap to bring back into the service compared to new ships, they are good cruise missile platforms, so I think they do have a role to play, Cheney said on NBC's Meet the Press.
0.266666666666667	5	Critics have charged that the battleship's 16-inch guns are antiquated and dangerous; gunners say they are among the most accurate available.
0.235294117647059	6	Navy investigators will be looking at all possibilities of human or mechanical error in their effort to determine what caused the explosion that killed 47 aboard the battleship USS Iowa, officials say.
0	6	It could take months before the probe is completed and the results released publicly, Navy spokesman Lt. Cmdr. Alan Dooley said Sunday.
0.704	6	A seven-member team of investigators boarded the battleship a day after the explosion flashed through the Iowa's No. 2 gun turret on Wednesday.
0.15609756097561	6	They're looking at any evidence of human error or mechanical error, or anything technical, said Lt. Janet Mescus, a spokeswoman at the Navy's information center at Norfolk, Va., the ship's home port.
1	6	The Iowa returned to Norfolk on Sunday.
0.0615384615384615	6	They're moving as quickly as they can, Lt. Mescus said, but added, They want to be thorough and that takes time.
0.114285714285714	6	Dooley said the investigation would be fairly complex because there were no witnesses.
0.576	6	There were 11 survivors inside the turret, all on the lowest deck loading powder from the ship's magazines, the Navy said.
0.177777777777778	6	Dooley said no information would be released until the probe is completed, and the Navy has refused to speculate on the cause of the explosion, which damaged only the inside of the turret.

0.15	7	Thousands of grieving friends and relatives of the fallen 47 crewmen from the battleship USS Iowa gathered quietly Monday and heard President Bush praise their loved ones as brothers in eternity.
0.235294117647059	7	We join today in mourning for the 47 who perished, and in fact, for the 11 who survived, the president told a packed memorial service at Norfolk Naval Air Station.
0	7	They all were, in the words of a poet, men behind the guns.'
0	7	They came from Hidalgo, Texas; Cleveland, Ohio; Tampa, Florida; Costa Mesa, California.
0.192	7	They came to the Navy as strangers, served the Navy as shipmates and friends, and left the Navy as brothers in eternity.
0.177777777777778	7	In the finest Navy tradition, they served proudly on a great battleship, the USS Iowa.
0.05	7	The president, a World War II Navy pilot, said he was proud to recommission the Iowa in 1984 and said it had earned 11 battle stars in two wars.
0.365714285714286	7	But with the still-unexplained fire and explosion last Wednesday in the battleship's No. 2 gun turret, he said, Fate has written a sorrowful chapter in the history of this great ship.
0.177777777777778	7	The Iowa's commander, Capt. Fred P. Moosally, said the turret's crew was the best gun crew on the ship, and called its chief Chief Gunner's Mate Reginald Owen Ziegler of Port Gibson, N.Y. my No. 1 chief.
0.064	7	Victims' relatives and hundreds of sailors and officers in dress blues were among the 6,000 people crowded into a hangar for the service.
0.2	7	A bouquet of red roses was placed in front of the podium; behind were an American flag and the battleship's banners.
0	7	Outside, another 2,000 people listened to the service on loudspeakers.
0	7	As many as 500 Iowa crewmen were unable to attend the service because they were delayed by traffic and were not permitted to enter the hangar because of security measures to protect Bush.
0	7	Many were angry they could not attend, said Machinist's Mate David Finn, 38.
0	7	It was very important to them, Finn said.
0	7	The service came a day after the World War II-era battleship eased into its home port, its gun barrels scorched and its 1,500 crewmen at the rails in white uniforms and black armbands in memory of their dead shipmates.
0.1	7	Moosally told the crowd of mourners that he remembered the men of turret No. 2.
0.0551724137931034	7	I remember their faces as they toiled at their guns, sweating an honest sweat that comes from young men dedicated to a great cause, he said.
0.0484848484848485	7	I remember as they talked among themselves, looking so much like sailors of the past, sharing the exuberance of the times and the dreams of the future, he said.
0	7	They were the life, the spirit and the soul of our ship.
0	7	They made the ultimate sacrifice for us.
0.1	7	The men of Turret Two will be part of the spirit of the Iowa forever.
0.0470588235294118	7	Bush recounted seeing the Iowa off the coast of the Philippines as a naval aviator in World War II, and the great sense of confidence the big ship lent to the fleet.
0	7	Addressing the children of the victims, he said: You must never forget that your father was America's pride.
0.114285714285714	7	At the end of the service, while the Navy Hymn was played, President and Mrs. Bush greeted and consoled the families of the lost men.
0.114285714285714	7	After the 45-minute service, the families attended a private reception with Moosally.
0.290909090909091	7	The Navy said 45 victims' families attended the service.
0	7	At a press briefing following the reception, Moosally praised the hundreds of men who fought the fire for their courage.
0	7	God gave birth to 500 heroes, the captain said.
0	7	Fire on a ship is the most terrifying fear you have nowhere to run.
0	7	Our extensive training paid off, he said.
0.0727272727272727	7	Besides the firefighting crews, we had cooks, engineers, deck seamen, Marines all fighting to save the ship.
0.168421052631579	7	Moosally said the blast occurred just as he was turning to Vice Adm. Jerome Johnson, commander of the 2nd Fleet, to tell him to watch the No. 2 turret because it contained his best crew.
0.177777777777778	7	This was my best turret, Moosally said.
0	7	He said turret chief Ziegler was the most meticulous of men.
0	7	He was my No. 1 chief of the 84 chiefs aboard.
0	7	Nobody in that turret did anything unless they were qualified, Moosally said.
0.106666666666667	7	Moosally refused to give a definite answer to reporters' questions about whether the damaged turret could be repaired, saying the battleship could operate without it if necessary.
0.228571428571429	7	All but 11 men in the huge gun turret died almost instantly last Wednesday when the explosion ripped through it.
0.4	7	At the time, the Iowa was conducting open seas gun exercises off Puerto Rico.
0.436363636363636	7	The Navy said the investigation into the blast is continuing.
0.246153846153846	7	Navy officials have refused to speculate on the cause of the explosion.
0.177777777777778	7	Cmdr. John P. Morse, the Iowa's weapons officer, said the guns were thoroughly inspected the morning of the accident, and Moosally said he had no hesitation about the guns' safety.
0.0888888888888889	7	I'll be in the turret for the first shot to go off, the captain said.
0.0695652173913043	7	One of the survivors, Gunner's Mate 3rd Class Kendall L. Truitt, 21, of Tampa, Fla., said that at first the men down in the powder magazine in the lowest level of the turret didn't know anything was wrong.
0	7	We were waiting for the gun to fire, and we weren't sure, he said.
0.0571428571428571	7	When the men discovered that no one was answering the interior turret communications link, Truitt ordered the powder returned to the magazine and the compartment evacuated.
0.0666666666666667	7	The sailors found smoke everywhere as they climbed through hatches and up ladders outside the turret toward the sea deck, Truitt recalled.
0	7	My first thought was that I'd better get to a lifeboat station, because if the fire got to the magazine things would be bad, he said.
0.228571428571429	8	A fiery explosion in a giant gun turret rocked the refitted battleship Iowa on maneuvers in the Atlantic today, killing at least 47 sailors and injuring an undetermined number, the Pentagon said.
0.302702702702703	8	Defense Department spokesman Dan Howard said the explosion may have resulted from the blast of a 110-pound gunpowder bag used to fire shells that weigh more than a ton a distance of up to 23 miles.

0.12972972972973	9	Norfolk Naval Base prepared to welcome home the Iowa, which is expected to arrive at the world's largest naval station this afternoon, and local merchants offered free services to families of the victims.
0.145454545454545	9	Lt. Cmdr. Alan Dooley said a team of six investigators was aboard the ship, searching for clues to the blast.
0.0923076923076923	9	He said no cause of death has been announced for any sailors, but the Washington Post reported that seamen in the upper chambers of gun turret No. 2 died instantly in the fiery explosion, whereas those in the lower levels were suffocated as the blast siphoned off their oxygen.
0	9	Dooley refused to comment on the newspaper report.
0.177777777777778	10	The scarred battleship Iowa made a somber return Sunday to its home port, where about 3,000 family members and friends of the crew welcomed loved ones who escaped an explosion that killed 47 sailors.

0.0842105263157895	10	Twenty minutes later, families started filing aboard the ship, exchanging tearful embraces with the returning sailors.
0.654545454545455	10	The explosion Wednesday flashed through the Iowa's No. 2 gun turret, which extends six decks down into the ship.
0.457142857142857	10	There were 11 survivors inside the turret, all on the lowest deck where they were loading powder from the ship's magazines, the Navy said.
0	10	Crewmen Stand on Turret
0.274285714285714	10	Two of the surviving crewmen of No. 2 turret stood on top of the fire-blackened turret as the ship pulled into the pier, with full crews on the ship's two other turrets.

0	10	Adm. Powell F. Carter, commander in chief of the Atlantic Fleet, was there to greet the vessel.
0.1	10	As the ship docked, three Marines raised a flag to half-staff at the stern.
0.0615384615384615	10	The Navy kept the news media about 300 yards from the families, and reporters were not allowed to talk with the families or crewmen.
0.228571428571429	10	The violence and power of the turret explosion was shown in an amateur videotape released by the Navy on Sunday.
0.133333333333333	10	The tape was made by an officer on the bridge of the Iowa who wanted to record the firing of the big guns.
0	10	Jet of Intense Fire
0.041025641025641	10	The detonation, which appears to blast away the gasket-like rubber that seal the turret's gun slits, is followed by a jet of intense fire and thick smoke from the front and base of the gunhouse.

0.431034482758621	0	Hurricane Hugo struck South Carolina with renewed fury Thursday after thousands of coastal residents in southeastern states grabbed what they could carry and fled inland on jammed highways.
0.0595238095238095	0	This is a disaster staring us right in the eye, Mayor Joseph P. Riley Jr. said from his City Hall command post in Charleston, where the hurricane downed power lines, snapped trees and caused utility transformers to explode.
0.0806451612903226	0	All we can do now is pray and hope all the precautions we have taken have been sufficient, Riley said as Hugo's eye bore in on the city.
0.15625	0	I just hope and pray we can get through this without any loss of life.
0	0	By midnight, 119 mph winds were reported in Charleston.

0	0	Phone and electric service to the command post was knocked out.
0.3125	0	Hurricane-force winds first hit the coast by 9:15 p.m. EDT, and about three hours later the eye of the storm passed over the Isle of Palms just east of Charleston, said Bob Sheets, director of the National Hurricane Center in Coral Gables, Fla.
0.3125	0	The eye was about 10 miles across and top winds were still at 135 mph.
0	0	Hugo was expected to turn gradually to the north, causing severe flooding as it moved up the East Coast.
0.0862068965517241	0	The storm posed a 19 percent chance of hitting New York City and a 16 percent chance of hitting Boston before Sunday night, the hurricane center said.
0	0	As Hugo neared the coast, roads from Hilton Head to Myrtle Beach, 200 miles north, were nearly empty, as were the boarded-up resort towns themselves.
0	0	Power lines and trees were downed in some spots and water flooded roads.
0	0	Stop lights and neon lights were knocked out in Myrtle Beach.
0	0	One eyewitness said like a light show,' said Amy Garrison, a reporter at WKZQ AM-FM in Myrtle Beach.
0.138888888888889	0	In Charleston, the hurricane littered streets with tin roofs, palmetto fronds and chunks of bark.
0	0	Businesses were closed and classes at public schools and universities canceled.
0	0	Riley ordered residents of one-story homes to evacuate.
0	0	Hospitals stockpiled supplies, discharging any patients well enough to go and moving others to hospitals inland to make room for emergency patients, officials said.
0.0609756097560976	0	About 12,000 people had checked into 83 shelters across the state as of Thursday evening, and more were expected, said Bennish Brown, a spokesman for the Emergency Operations Center in Columbia, 220 miles northwest of here.

0	0	Our resources are very tight.
0	0	Right now Hugo is shaping up to be one of our biggest relief operations of the decade.
0.113636363636364	0	At midnight, the center of Hugo was near latitude 32.7 degrees north and longitude 79.9 degrees west, forecasters said.
0	0	The hurricane's speed had picked up to 22 mph from 20 mph earlier.
0.357142857142857	0	Near its center, Hugo's muscle reached winds of 135 mph, up from 125 mph earlier in the day and 105 mph the day before.
0.113636363636364	0	North and South Carolina can expect tornadoes linked to Hugo for the next two days, according to the hurricane center.
0	0	The coastal area could expect hurricane force winds for 10 to 12 hours once the eye comes ashore, officials said.
0.0510204081632653	0	A hurricane warning was in effect between Fernandina Beach, Fla., and Oregon Inlet, N.C. By late afternoon, Hugo was upgraded to a category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson scale of strength, the second mightiest category, which indicated it could cause extreme damage.
0	0	It strengthened more than we thought it would, Sheets said, adding that Hugo would cause severe flooding as it moved up the Appalachians.
0.0390625	0	The timing of the landfall was critical because of the storm's tidal surge, a dome of water 10 to 15 feet high that would feed a normal 5-foot high tide that peaks after 2 a.m. On top of that will be waves, Sheets said earlier, and in many places on barrier islands the buildings will be swept clean off.
0.161290322580645	1	This historic city has survived the ravages of earthquake, battle and storm in its storied 300-year-history, but it faced perhaps its greatest test of all in Hurricane Hugo.
0.441176470588235	1	The storm, packing winds of up to 135 mph, raged into Charleston Thursday night.
0	1	This is a dangerous, killer hurricane, the likes of which few people who have lived all their lives in Charleston have experienced, warned Mayor Joseph P. Riley Jr.
0	1	Hugo was the first major hurricane to strike Charleston since Hurricane Gracie came ashore 70 miles to the south in 1959.
0	1	The seaside community has suffered through many disasters, both natural and man-made.
0.0757575757575758	1	The worst in recent decades was in 1938 when a tornado tore through the city, killing 32 people, injuring hundreds and causing an estimated $2 million in property damage.
0.108695652173913	1	Charleston, a city of pastel-colored antebellum structures lining quaint streets and alleyways, is where the Civil War began in 1861.
0	1	The city has survived the shot and shell of two wars and any number of smaller hurricanes, politely referred to by Charlestonians of refinement as September gales.
0	1	But the worst natural disaster to beset the city occurred on the hot night of Aug. 31, 1886, when the ground rumbled in what some folks thought was a prelude to Judgement Day.
0	1	The great Charleston earthquake was felt as far away as Chicago and New York City.
0	1	Measuring 7.7 on the Richter scale of ground motion, the earthquake claimed an estimated 110 lives, destroyed 102 buildings and tossed most of the city's 14,000 chimneys into the streets.
0	1	In recent years, the city has attracted millions of visitors annually who tour its historic buildings and visit its nearby fine sand beaches.
0	1	Charleston has received international acclaim as home to Spoleto Festival U.S.A., founded by composer Gian Carlo Menotti.
0	1	Organizers like to refer to Spoleto as the world's most comprehensive arts festival.
0.333333333333333	2	Amid the uproar of live coverage by the major networks and scores of other media organizations, National Hurricane Center forecasters went about their business of monitoring Hurricane Hugo.
0	2	The whole system looks chaotic, but it works, said Bob Sheets, the center's director.
0	2	On one side of a large room dominated by a U-shaped bank of monitoring equipment were the forecasters, making meticulous calculations about where the deadly hurricane will strike and getting emergency operations going in those areas.
0	2	On the other side were the media a pack of reporters, camera operators and technicians, jockeying for seconds of Sheets' time and tidbits of his expertise.
0	2	In the center was Sheets himself.
0.135135135135135	2	Surrounded by cameras, wires and two dozen journalists with pads and telephones, the ubiquitous red-headed meteorologist has appeared on television all week next to a large satellite monitor showing colorful images of Hurricane Hugo.
0	2	During prime news time, competing technicians and cameramen shout and make rude hand gestures for people to get out of their shots of Sheets.
0.119047619047619	2	At his back, casually dressed forecasters who have been working 12-hour days tracked the storm via computers and satellites.
0	2	We obviously don't like this and could probably do a better job, but everyone knows now because of the media, said hurricane specialist Max Mayfield.
0.357142857142857	2	In the Caribbean, we were not so certain the word got out.
0.277777777777778	2	But we know the Carolinas have been evacuated.
0	2	When a hurricane warning goes into effect, It's a $50 million statement, said meteorologist Joel Cline, referring to the cost of emergency preparations and evacuation plans that must be implemented when the warning is posted.
0	2	If we weren't here, then you wouldn't know that a storm was out there, he said.
0.357142857142857	2	Before the hurricane warning system was established, a storm of Hugo's power would have cost thousands of lives.
0.151515151515152	2	But early today, after days of warnings and proper evacuation procedures, there were no immediate reports of deaths despite widespread damage in Charleston and other coastal areas of South Carolina.
0.125	2	I like to think that we make a difference a far as human lives are concerned, Cline said.
0.0925925925925926	2	After Hugo's landfall, Sheets and the other forecasters began to wind down from the hectic pace they had maintained for the last several days.
0	2	But, he warned, the hurricane center still is following three other weather systems that have moved into the Atlantic between the United States and Africa, and another storm in the Pacific.
0.192307692307692	2	I hate to say we're breathing a sigh of relief because people are getting clobbered to death, meteorologist Mark Zimmer said as the storm pounded Charleston, S.C. But we've done all we can.
0.161290322580645	3	Supercomputers, satellites and the expertise of several hurricane forecasters predicted the destructive path Hurricane Hugo would follow, giving people plenty of time to flee the South Carolina coast.
0	3	But hurricane tracking remains an uncertain science.
0.377358490566038	3	Forecasters at the National Hurricane Center used computer models to track Hugo's path into Charleston, S.C. All the world's knowledge about meteorological conditions and forecasting changes in those conditions is embodied in those models, said Thomas Pyke, head of National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's satellite service.
0.2	3	Pinpointing the exact point of Hugo's landfall was difficult, but forecasters said Friday that the landfall was predicted in time for evacuation.
0.142857142857143	3	Overall, I think the tracking models gave us a very good idea where Hugo would be so officials in South Carolina could act in a timely manner, said research meteorologist Colin McAdie.
0.166666666666667	3	The real forecasting problem with Hugo was predicting the intensity of the storm, which was upgraded to a Category 4 hurricane just hours before it slammed into Charleston.
0	3	It is very difficult to predict changes in intensity because we don't have very reliable computer models for that, McAdie said.
0	3	We really need to improve on our forecasting ability of strength.
0.217391304347826	3	The hurricane specialists were surprised by the last-minute increase in wind speed, which was reported to them by Air Force reconnaissance.
0	3	Hurricane specialist Gil Clark, who has tracked hurricanes for 35 years, said that a couple of decades ago, the only forecasting tools were reports from aircraft or ships.
0	3	We had no radar or satellites then, so needless to say our forecasts were less accurate, Clark said.
0	3	In the late 1960s, the weather service began using satellites to obtain a global weather picture.
0	3	Information from the satellite is used to improve the accuracy of the large-scale models that television viewers see every night.
0.174418604651163	3	Using the information from the satellite, supercomputers at the National Meteorological Center in Suitland, Md., send information to the hurricane center where a tracking model constantly changes to account for current weather conditions and the position of the hurricane.
0.0833333333333333	3	To determine the track of the storm, the forecasters analyze supercomputer predictions, satellite data, the history of similar storms and the current path of the hurricane.
0	3	Then they make an educated guess about the landfall.
0	3	Meteorology professor Kerry A. Emmanuel of the Massachussetts Institute of Technology criticizes the current forecasting system.
0	3	Congress and the American people are suffering from the collective delusion that our data problems have been solved by satellites and that just isn't true, Emmanuel said.
0	3	Satellites can give a pretty picture, he said, but not enough information about the wind and temperatures that affect a hurricane's path.
0	3	Most of the information actually used to predict hurricanes comes from flying airplanes into the hurricane, and they do a very good job, Emmanuel said.
0	3	Forecasters say the accuracy of satellite pictures is improving every year so long-range forecasting should become more precise.
0.0757575757575758	3	We have to remember that those models used are only guidance products, Pyke said, and that it's ultimately the job of the forecaster to predict the storm's path.

0.166666666666667	4	Hurricane is again classified as a Category 4 hurricane, capable of extreme damage.
0.833333333333333	4	Sept. 21 Hugo crashes into Charleston, S.C., with winds of 135 mph, leveling buildings and flooding streets.
0	4	In addition to flooding, fires from natural gas leaks erupt in Charleston.
0	4	Several other coastal communities also suffer heavy damage.
0.625	4	Ten people in the Carolinas are killed.
0	4	Sept. 22 The hurricane, with steadily diminishing winds, continues to move inland and is downgraded to a tropical storm.
0	4	Further weakening is expected as it moves north with its load of heavy rain.
0	4	Sept. 22 Hugo was downgraded to a tropical storm at 6 a.m. Friday.
0.0757575757575758	4	Twelve hours later it had all but lost the characteristics of a tropical storm and was weakening, although the weather system featured maximum sustained winds of 40 mph and torrential rains.
0	4	Its last location was just west of Pittsburgh, Pa., at latitude 40.5 degrees north and longitude 81 degrees west.
0	4	Officials said no further tracking would be done.
0.15625	5	The greenhouse effect may breed bigger and deadlier hurricanes in the future, storms up to 50 percent stronger than Hugo and last year's record-setting Gilbert, some meteorologists say.
0.454545454545455	5	Hugo blasted the eastern Caribbean and the Carolinas with 135 mph winds this past week, killing at least 41 people.
0	5	Just before Hugo struck the U.S. coast, its pressure was measured at 940 millibars.
0.288461538461538	5	That made it among the 12 strongest hurricanes this century to hit the United States, the National Hurricane Center's Miles Lawrence said today.
0.104166666666667	5	Gilbert, whose winds reached 180 mph, tore up the Caribbean last year, killing 300 and causing $2 billion damage.
0	5	It was the most powerful hurricane ever recorded.
0.0833333333333333	5	Gilbert seems to be about the upper limit of a hurricane with current ocean temperatures, said Kerry Emanuel of the meteorology department at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
0.128205128205128	5	But if the seas warm up, say by 3 to 6 degrees Fahrenheit, the wind speeds might be 25 percent higher which means the destructive force would be more like 50 percent higher, he said.
0.0961538461538462	5	Stephen Schneider, deputy director of the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Denver, said his research suggests the warming trend is already here.
0.151515151515152	5	Schneider, an expert on the greenhouse effect and author of a new book Global Warming, said six of the 10 hottest years in the last 100 occurred in the 1980s.
0	5	He projects that the 1990s will be even hotter.
0.514705882352941	5	Hugo demonstrated the effect of warm Atlantic waters when its winds jumped from 105 mph to 135 mph as it passed over the Gulf Stream before hitting the East Coast, Schneider said.
0.178571428571429	5	You'll get worse hurricanes if the Caribbean is warmer, he said.
0	5	And I think there are better-than-even odds that you will have stronger hurricanes.
0	5	Emanuel said if the ocean temperature climbs, moderate hurricanes of the future could grow to Gilbert's strength and future Gilberts will be even stronger.
0	5	Gilbert was so strong that Bob Sheets, director of the national hurricane center, said forecasters may have to use an intensity scale of 1-6 in the future, instead of the current 1-5, with five the highest.
0.106382978723404	5	The computer models Schneider uses show that in a worst-case scenario, over the next 100 years the world's temperature could jump by 10 degrees if carbon dioxide and methane gas which both contribute to the greenhouse effect continue to pour into the atmosphere unchecked.
0.119047619047619	5	It is possible that even though the world as a whole heats up, the Caribbean could somehow remain cooler.
0	5	But he said that is unlikley.
0	5	That's not what the models are showing, Schneider said.
0	5	And that's another reason I'd like to slow down global warming.
0.208333333333333	6	Residents took forecasters at their word when they warned of Hurricane Hugo's fury, and the low number of deaths from the powerful storm can be credited to this healthy respect, authorities said.
0.416666666666667	6	The storm, which caused billions in damage, claimed 17 lives in South Carolina, and only two were in the Charleston area, which bore the brunt of Hugo's 135 mph winds.
0.119047619047619	6	We just feel very thankful about that, said Mayor Joseph P. Riley Jr. Several thousands of people who were in the shelters and the tens of thousands of people who evacuated inland were potential victims of injury and death.
0.119047619047619	6	Riley and other officials credited residents with monitoring the hurricane as it spun toward Charleston, and heeding evacuation warnings.
0.217391304347826	6	The last big storm to hit South Carolina was Hurricane David in 1979, which hit the coast after pounding southern Florida.
0.104166666666667	6	Since then several big storms have threatened but veered away, and officials were worried that Charlestonians wouldn't heed Hugo's warnings.
0.125	6	We've had so many close calls, said Gary Garnet, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service.
0	6	But this storm was very, very strong, he said.
0	6	This time they realized it.
0.108695652173913	6	Glen Ellis, a Red Cross official, estimated that 18,000 residents in Charleston and the three surrounding counties headed for shelters.
0	6	Tens of thousands more got into their cars and headed up Interstate 26 toward Columbia.
0.113636363636364	6	Mayor John Bourne of North Charleston, where there apparently were no storm-related deaths, credited people for heeding the warnings.
0	6	It was bad, but it could have been a lot worse, he said.
0	6	You've just got to say nice things about the people.
0	6	Meanwhile, Garnet had some good news for storm-weary Charlestonians: late Saturday the tropics were quiet with no other storms brewing.
0	6	There's nothing to worry about out there, he said.
0.258620689655172	7	The two dominant home and automobile insurers in the Carolinas said Tuesday that they expect to be hit with about $600 million in claims from Hurricane Hugo.
0.277777777777778	7	Such heavy losses suggest that the storm will be the most expensive ever for the insurance industry.
0.0806451612903226	7	State Farm Insurance Co. expects claims as high as $400 million in South Carolina, where it insures one out of every five homes, spokesman Jerry Parsons said.
0.0925925925925926	7	The Bloomington, Ill.-based company is also projecting an additional $100 million in claims from storm damage in North Carolina and Virginia, he said.
0.113636363636364	7	Additionally, Nationwide Insurance Co. said it expects claims close to $100 million, more than triple the $31 million that the company paid for damages caused by Hurricane Elena when it swept through Florida, Alabama and Mississippi in 1985.
0	7	previous all-time high was in 1983, when we paid $165 million in comparable claims for Hurricane Alicia, which struck Galveston and Houston.
0	7	There were a phenomenal number of claims from that storm, but there was not the severity of damage" as in Hugo, Parsons said.
0.131578947368421	7	Officials said property damage from Hugo escalated because the storm scored a direct hit on Charleston and then, instead of heading out to sea, veered northwest, hitting other population centers, including Charlotte, N.C.
0	7	Losses Still Being Tallied
0.0735294117647059	7	Nationwide, based in Columbus, Ohio, is the biggest home and auto insurance in North Carolina, where damage was unexpectedly high, and is the third-largest insurer in South Carolina.
0	7	have so far received 16,000 claims," spokesman Bob Sohozich said.
0	7	Although claims adjusters are still tallying the losses, there is now little doubt that overall damage to insured property will far exceed the record $752.5 million in claims paid by the industry after Hurricane Frederic struck Mississippi and Alabama in 1979, Parsons said.
0.138888888888889	7	The Insurance Information Institute is expected to issue a report Thursday on overall insured losses from Hugo.
0	7	Although the losses are substantial, they are not expected to threaten the financial health of any individual company because reinsurers will pick up a significant portion of the costs.
0	7	For example, Nationwide said it would be responsible for up to $30 million in claims, while its reinsurers would cover up to $150 million in damages.
0	7	Reinsurers which share a portion of the risk on an insurance policy in exchange for part of the premium income typically spread their risk over many hundreds of companies.
0.0625	7	Analysts said most of the claims will be borne by mutual insurance companies, which are owned by policyholders, but they noted that losses from Hurricane Hugo would also affect the short-term earnings of some publicly traded companies.
0.0862068965517241	7	Continental Corp. said it expects to report a pretax charge of $50 million for the third quarter, reflecting its net exposure to damages from the storm.
0	7	The New York-based company had substantial business in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, where Hugo first struck with devastating force.
0	7	Forecasts May Be Cut
0	7	The charge might push Continental into the red for the quarter, said Udayan Ghose, an analyst with Shearson Lehman Hutton in New York.
0	7	there is a profit, it will be a very small one," he said.
0	7	The charge will cut expected annual earnings by close to 25%, he added.
0	7	Ghose said Shearson may also cut its third-quarter and annual earnings projections for Cigna Corp., USF&amp;G Corp. and Lincoln National Corp., which are expected to suffer hurricane-related losses equal to about 10% of expected full-year earnings.
0	7	Overall 1989 catastrophic losses for the industry now total about $1.6 billion, and analysts expect Hugo to make this year the costliest.
0	7	But could be a positive for the industry," Ghose said, explaining that the industry is in the middle of a price war because it is overcapitalized.
0	7	Billions of dollars in losses from Hugo and other catastrophes this year would have significant impact on excess capital," he said, causing insurance firms to raise prices shortly.
0	7	would be good for the companies and shareholders," he said.
0.416666666666667	8	Damage from Hurricane Hugo, which stormed through the Carolinas and the Caribbean last week, will reduce third-quarter earnings for several insurers.
0	8	New York-based American International Group Inc. expects net losses related to Hugo to reduce pretax earnings between $35 million and $45 million.
0	8	Analysts said AIG has told them that it must cover the first $35 million of losses and that its reinsurance agreements will cover the bulk of the remaining damages.
0.394736842105263	8	AIG insured property in Puerto Rico, the eastern Caribbean Islands and the coastal regions of the Carolinas.
0.104166666666667	8	St. Paul Cos., based in St. Paul, Minn, said the pretax cost of Hugo shouldn't exceed $50 million.
0	8	That amount takes into consideration what St. Paul expects to recover under its reinsurance contracts, the company said.
0.147058823529412	8	Philadelphia-based Cigna Corp. is expected to disclose Hugo's likely impact on its earnings sometime today.
0	8	Udayan Ghose, an insurance industry analyst at Shearson Lehman Hutton in New York, estimates that Cigna's third-quarter per-share earnings could be reduced by between 50 cents and 65 cents a share on an after-tax basis.
0	8	That would wipe out 35% to 40% of his $1.40-a-share earnings estimate for the third quarter.
0.125	8	State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co. said its State Fire Casualty Co. unit estimates claim payments from Hugo will exceed $400 million in South Carolina alone, far surpassing the company's record payout for a single disaster.
0.113636363636364	8	When damages in North Carolina and Virginia are added, the company said, the payments will exceed $500 million.
0	8	It said that is more than three times the previous record of $165 million set by Hurricane Alicia, which hit the Houston-Galveston, Texas, area in 1983.

0.483516483516484	3	The assault followed two weeks of tension between Kuwait and Iraq, caused by Iraqi accusations that Kuwait stole oil from a disputed border area.
0.916666666666667	3	Saddam also accused Kuwait of exceeding OPEC production quotas, thus driving down the price of oil, a major Iraqi revenue source.
0	3	The attack had wide-ranging ramifications: prices soared $3 a barrel in early trading because of fears the invasion would disrupt supplies.
0	3	Prices were about $2 higher later.
0.330827067669173	3	Bush signed orders freezing Iraqi assets in the United States and blocking most Iraqi imports, including oil.

0	3	of State James A. Baker III planned to fly to Moscow to issue a rare joint statement Friday with Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze about the invasion.
0	3	The plan, which was announced in Washington, illustrates the dramatic improvement in relations between the superpowers, who once routinely lined up on opposite sides of most regional disputes.
0	3	Kuwait's U.S. ambassador, Sheik Saud Nasir al-Sabah, told reporters in Washington: We are desperate for any help we can get.
0.448979591836735	3	He appealed specifically for American intervention.
0.554621848739496	3	In recent days, diplomats said Iraq had massed more than 100,000 troops at the border.
0	3	Kuwait's entire armed forces has 20,300 soldiers.
0.369747899159664	3	Bush said the United States would take whatever steps necessary to defend interests in the gulf.
0.196428571428571	3	Asked if this included military force, Bush said: We're not discussing intervention.
0	3	But he said he would not discuss military options publicly.
0	3	It was the first time in modern history an Arab nation had invaded another and taken over its government.
0	3	Kuwait's army was no match for Iraq, battle-hardened after eight years of war with Iran.
0	3	Iraq has emerged as the Arab world's strongest and most militant military power, and Saddam has a vast arsenal of chemical and conventional weapons.
0.136645962732919	3	Diplomats said about 350 Iraqi tanks wheeled into the capital a few hours after crossing the border 40 miles away at dawn.
0.174603174603175	3	Witnesses said the bombardment of ports and military airports by artillery and the air force was vicious.
0	3	The invaders surrounded the palace of Kuwait's ruler, Sheik Jaber al-Ahmed al-Sabah.
0	3	Residents said the palace was seized after about two hours of heavy artillery barrages.
0	3	Diplomats said Sheik Fahd al-Ahmed al-Sabah, one of the emir's brothers, was killed while trying to defend the palace.
0	3	There were about 50 tanks around the palace and the neighboring American Embassy, residents said.
0	3	The al-Sabah family has ruled the city-state for almost 250 years.
0.261904761904762	3	The Kuwaiti ambassador said the leaders were safe in Saudi Arabia.
0	3	Operating from an unknown location, al-Ahmed's government responded to the formation of the provisional government by stating: Kuwait is Kuwait to its people, let by the emir, Sheik Jaber, and his Crown Prince Sheik Saad.
0	3	God preserve them from all harm.
0	3	For its part, the provisional government announced through Baghdad's official Iraqi News Agency that it was dissolving parliament and would hold free and honest elections at a future date.
0.142857142857143	3	The Iraqi forces were led by the elite Republican Guard, which did the brunt of fighting in the Iran-Iraq war.
0	3	Troops set up roadblocks at major intersections and shot at cars that did not stop.
0	3	Baghdad television said Iraq qould withdraw its forces within days or weeks, depending on how quickly the situation stabilized.
0	3	Kuwait's land and sea borders were closed, as was the airport.
0	3	Diplomats said the invasion was too swift to arrange the evacuation of nationals, and foreigners were asked to keep a low profile.
0.241758241758242	3	There are about 4,000 Americans among the large expatriate community in Kuwait, where more than 60 percent of the 1.8 million residents are foreigners.
0	3	U.S. officials monitoring the situation had no reports of harm to U.S. citizens in Iraq, White House spokesman Roman Popadiuk said.
0	3	Foreigners reached by telephone said they watched from their windows or dived for cover as the invasion began.
0	3	We were totally unprepared, said Catherine Baker of Illinois.
0	3	One feels like there should have been a bit of warning.
0	3	The British Embassy was hit by shell-fire and the Sheraton and Hilton hotels evacuated their clientele, the diplomats said.
0.184873949579832	3	The invasion came hours after Iraq broke off talks intended to mend its differences with Kuwait.
0	3	Iraqi first threatened military action against its former ally Kuwait two weeks ago.
0	3	Washington declared its support for Kuwait from the start.
0	3	During the Iran-Iraq war, American ships protected U.S.-flagged Kuwaiti tankers from attacks in the gulf.
0.273291925465839	4	Iraqi President Saddam Hussein seemed determined to solve his financial problems and fulfill territorial ambitions by dethroning the government of neighboring Kuwait.
0	4	The invasion, unprecedented in modern Arab history, reflected the brutality Saddam has used to crush all opposition at home since coming to power in 1979.
0.202764976958525	4	The sentence for criticizing Saddam is death, and the president considered Kuwait's oil overproduction and the subsequent fall in the price of oil a personal affront to Iraq.
0	4	Iraqis will not forget the saying that cutting necks is better than cutting means of living.
0	4	Oh God Almighty, be witness that we have warned them, he said last month after prices tumbled below $14 per barrel.
0.506912442396313	4	He accused Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates of costing Iraq $14 billion in lost oil revenue by ignoring their quotas assigned by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.
0.383275261324042	4	He also accused Kuwait of stealing $2.4 billion by pumping oil from a disputed field that straddled their border, and demanded that Kuwait write off an estimated $15 billion it loaned Iraq during the Persian Gulf war.
0	4	Saddam was reported to be incensed that Kuwait was demanding repayment for the wartime loans.
0	4	Saddam said he fought the war to protect the Arabs from the fundamentalist revolution fomented by the late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini in Persian, mainly Shiite Moslem Iran.
0.101382488479263	4	Never mind that Iraq started the war in 1980 by invading Iran after a series of border skirmishes along the Shatt-al-Arab waterway, Iraq's only outlet to the Gulf.
0	4	Despite claims that the war was an unprecedented victory, the long conflict stalled Iraq's development, dragging on for eight years.
0	4	It has still not formally ended.
0.157142857142857	4	The war bills kept the government from delivering material benefits promised to the Iraqi people directly after the war.
0	4	The 1990 budget slashed funds for imports and Iraqis were told to brace for another year of austerity.
0	4	Private investment has failed to take hold.
0	4	Iraq ended the war an estimated $70 billion in debt.
0	4	Its main gulf port of Basra is still blocked and its oil infrastructure damaged.
0	4	Tens of thousands of Iraqi prisoners of war languish in Iranian prisons and an estimated 500,000 Iraqis were killed or wounded.
0	4	Despite its puny size, Kuwait's oil reserves almost match Iraq's 100 billion barrels.
0.116402116402116	4	By controlling Kuwait, Saddam could help solve the financial hangover from the Persian Gulf war and fulfill Iraq's longstanding wish for more gulf coastline.
0.216748768472906	4	Iraq's 100,000 troops massed at the border in the past few weeks were believed part of a pressure campaign to make Kuwait capitulate to Iraq's demands.
0.0827067669172932	4	But Kuwait's pledge two weeks ago to obey new OPEC quotas and Saddam's promise to Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak that he would not invade lulled the Arab world into the sense the crisis was over.
0	4	Homage to the cause of Arab unity has been paramount in Middle East politics since postwar independence from colonial powers.
0	4	Although a civil war in Yemen in the 1960s brought Egyptian and Saudi Arabian intervention on opposing sides, no Arab state has ever directly deposed the government of a fellow Arab League member.
0.157142857142857	4	Despite Iraqi claims that it is helping internal opposition liberate Kuwait, it has long coveted the tiny emirate.
0.362637362637363	4	The Iraqi government refused to recognize its independence in 1961 and threatened to attack then, but backed down when Britain landed troops in Kuwait.
0	4	The invasion shook Kuwait's neighbors along the Gulf.
0.232804232804233	4	It proved the decade-old Gulf Cooperation Council that groups Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, Oman and Kuwait was toothless.
0	4	The GCC did not issue a statement, much less implement its mutual defense treaty.
0.125714285714286	4	While Iraq was unlikely to invade Saudi Arabia, it could use the precedent of Kuwait to browbeat its neighbors on local policy issues.
0.149659863945578	4	Bombing an oil field would be a sufficient reminder of what happened to Kuwait when it balked at Iraqi demands.
0	4	Also in a region entirely ruled by absolute monarchs, the fall of one makes the rest feel extremely vulnerable.
0.157142857142857	4	In a series of bellicose statements in recent months, Saddam has sought to focus domestic attention outside Iraq.
0	4	In March he threatened to burn half of Israel with Iraq's chemical weapons banned under international law if Iraq was attacked.
0	4	It was a popular stance among Arabs frustrated with the lack of progress toward peace and a Palestinian nation in the Arab-Israeli conflict.
0	4	Then Britain arrested several people on charges they were smuggling nuclear triggers into Baghdad.
0	4	Weeks later, police in Europe impounded what they said was parts to a supergun capable of firing chemical or nuclear shells into Israel.
0.174603174603175	4	Saddam cried foul, claiming the West was trying to wreck the scientific progress of the Arabs.
0	4	Saddam has sought to inherit the mantle of the late Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nassar as the leader of the Arab world.
0	4	His relentless personality cult has dubbed him The Knight of the Arabs.
0	4	For Kuwait on Thursday, he was a dark knight.
0	4	Asked the reason for the invasion, Kuwait's ambassador to Washington Sheik Saud Nasir Al-Sabah said at a news conference: Ambition.
0.523809523809524	4	Control of the whole area.
0	4	There is not any reason for it.

0	6	Iraq declared earlier that the provisional government installed by Baghdad is capable of ensuring security in the occupied country.
0	6	Baghdad television has said the new government is headed by Col. Ala Hussein Ali and that he holds the positions of prime minister, commander-in-chief of the armed forces, minister of defense and interior minister.
0	6	The other eight members were lieutenant colonels and majors.
0	6	But Kuwait's embassy in Amman, Jordan, on Sunday dismissed the new government as a list of fake names and said Ali is Saddam's son-in-law.
0	6	A similar report appeared in one of Cairo's leading newspapers, Al-Ahram.

1	7	UNITED NATIONS The United States urged other U.N. members at talks Sunday to impose broad economic and military sanctions on Iraq.
0	7	Western diplomats said the world body is expected to adopt the measures.

0.20952380952381	9	However, Iraq's ambassador to Washington, Mohammed al Mashat, said Iraq had invaded Kuwait in response to a request from the nation's free government."
0	9	He warned the West not to consider foreign interference in the current events."
0	9	Iraq's explanation was quickly denounced by the State Department, which said Baghdad's claim that its troops moved into Kuwait at that country's request is fraud."
0.582010582010582	9	In a related development, the State Department confirmed that invading Iraqi troops had rounded up six American oil field workers near the border of Kuwait.
0	9	Their whereabouts is not known.
0.146179401993355	9	Despite Bush's refusal to rule out military action, it appeared an unlikely option given the strength of Iraq's military, the limited U.S. forces in the region and the opposition to U.S. intervention from other countries in the area.
0.314285714285714	9	Officials said the Bush Administration's energies are focused mainly on organizing international economic and diplomatic pressure against Iraq.
0.136645962732919	9	Even so, the strongest economic weapon, an international ban on Iraqi oil exports, also appears unlikely to be employed.
0	9	At a joint news conference with British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, who is scheduled to give a speech to the nonprofit Aspen Institute on Sunday, Bush said that Secretary of State James A. Baker III will discuss the Persian Gulf situation with Soviet officials in Moscow today.

0	9	The meeting was arranged after Baker met with the Soviet ambassador to Mongolia, who described the Kremlin's plans for a strong Soviet stand on the invasion.
0.165413533834586	9	Baker, at a news conference in Ulan Bator early today, said there have been no reports of U.S casualties in Kuwait and that integrity of foreign embassies seems to have been preserved so far."
0.349206349206349	9	He said the estimate of the number of Iraqi troops in Kuwait varies from 50,000 to 100,000.
0	9	Bush flew to Colorado after meeting early in the morning with his National Security Council to discuss the Persian Gulf situation.
0	9	Originally, the President had planned to spend the night in Colorado and return to Washington today.
0	9	Instead, he returned to Washington on Thursday night.
0	9	Before leaving the capital Thursday morning, Bush told reporters at the White House that he was contemplating" any U.S. military involvement.
0.157142857142857	9	But later in the day, at the news conference with Thatcher, Bush moved away from that pledge.
0	9	He said that he had met during the day with top defense advisers and not ruling any options out."
0	9	The trade embargo imposed by Bush would cut off all commerce with Iraq, except news reporting, exports of publications and shipments of emergency relief supplies of food and medicine.
0	9	Like Bush, Thatcher has frozen Iraqi and Kuwaiti assets, but she has not imposed a trade embargo.
0	9	Iraq is highly dependent on oil exports to finance its large armed forces and considerable national debt.
0.285714285714286	9	But Europe and Japan are far more dependent on Middle Eastern oil than is the United States, and an international oil embargo on Iraq would be painful for many U.S. allies.
0.165413533834586	9	At the joint news conference, Thatcher called for U.N. actions to impose additional trade sanctions against Iraq.
0	9	Asked about an oil embargo, however, she stopped short.

0.235714285714286	9	Bush spent the day discussing the Iraqi invasion with senior advisers and other heads of state, including the heads of Egypt, Yemen and Jordan, Arab leaders whom the President described as of the United States."
0	9	The Arab leaders, Bush said, had appealed to him for and short period of time" in which to develop an solution."
0	9	Bush expressed sympathy with the Arab effort but added that made clear to them that it had gone beyond simply a regional dispute."
0.285714285714286	9	Later Thursday, the White House said that Bush had spoken with King Fahd of Saudi Arabia for about 30 minutes.
0	9	The statement said the two leaders agreed that the invasion was and possible options for dealing with the situation."
0.330827067669173	9	At a news conference in Washington, Kuwaiti ambassador Saud appealed to the United States for military assistance.
0	9	people are suffering," Saud said, adding that Kuwait is requesting aid everyone who has conscience and fair play around this world."
0	9	Referring to Kuwait's request for U.S. military intervention, he said: don't stand a chance if we don't get aid from our friends."
0.285714285714286	9	Mashat, Baghdad's ambassador to the United States, said in a statement given to reporters in Washington that Iraq hoped to withdraw its forces within a few days or weeks.
0.157142857142857	9	events currently occurring in Kuwait are an internal affair with which Iraq has no relation," Mashat said.
0.628571428571429	9	Meanwhile, the United States asked Iraq to account for the six missing American oil company employees in Kuwait.
0	9	Times staff writers Maura Reynolds, Michael Ross and Don Shannon, in Washington, and Jim Mann, in Ulan Bator, Mongolia, contributed to this story.

0	5	This Saturday marks the 10th anniversary of Owens' death at age 66.
0.105555555555556	5	The president later hailed Owens's multiple gold medals in the Berlin games a victory for humanity in prepared remarks to a banquet sponsored by the U.S. Olympic Committee.
0.306451612903226	5	The Olympics, like democracy, are a kind of dialogue a way that nations can converse in the language of friendly competition, not deadly conflict, Bush said.
0.226190476190476	5	Bush called Owens, who was black, an Olympic hero and an American hero every day of his life born with the gift of burning speed.
0	5	He was always the fastest, said Bush, recalling the afternoon in May 1935 when the Ohio State runner broke three world records and tied a fourth in the space of 45 minutes.
0	5	Talk about a guy in a hurry, Bush laughed.
0	5	He was the epitome of that.
0.234567901234568	5	At the 1936 Olympic Games in Berlin, Owens captured four gold medals in the broad jump, 100-meter dash, 200-meter dash and 400-meter relay.
0.218390804597701	5	The Berlin Games were to be the showcase of Hitler's theories on the superiority of the master race until this 23-year-old kid showed up, Bush said.
0	5	It was an unrivaled athletic triumph.
0	5	But more than that, it really was a triumph for all humanity.
0.191919191919192	5	Bush, borrowing a phrase from Ruth Owens, said it was not those athletic feats but his humanitarian contributions in the race of life that earned Owens the Congressional Gold Medal.
0	5	Owens devoted himself to working with youth and serving as a special ambassador for sports, said Bush.
0.243589743589744	5	He said the athlete's legacy lives on through the Jesse Owens Games, a playground Olympics; the Jesse Owens International Trophy for amateur athletes and the Jesse Owens Foundation, which awards scholarships to needy youth.
0.150793650793651	5	Despite the many honors, his greatest satisfaction came from his work with youth, said Mrs. Owens, 74.
0.059748427672956	5	Attending the ceremony along with Owens' family were former Olympians Mal Whitfield, Harrison Dillard and Herb Douglass; former teammates John Chavers, Samuel Devine and Chester Thomas, and two Ohio Democrats, Sen. Howard Metzenbaum and Rep. Louis Stokes, who spearheaded the drive to strike the medal.
0.175925925925926	5	The silver-haired Mrs. Owens, standing outside the White House afterwards, called the event absolutely beautiful.
0	5	She added: I'm sure with the sun shining straight down, Jesse's watching us, too.
0	6	TONIGHT in the big stadium in Barcelona the athletics is dominated by the four relay finals.
0	6	Tonight it is nation versus nation.
0.0833333333333333	6	What the relays demonstrate more clearly than any other athletics event is that at the Olympics the race has traditionally gone to affluent countries or to those, rather, that choose to lavish resources on athletes.
0.197916666666667	6	The US has comfortably won the most relay medals, followed by Britain, the former Soviet Union, the former West Germany the former East Germany, France and Canada.
0	6	Britain alone have won more relay medals than all the Caribbean islands and Africa
0	6	The Dutch, with one, have more relay medals than all the nations of Asia and South America combined.
0.117283950617284	6	The Cuban women's 100 metres relay teams of 1968 and 1972 are the only women from outside the developed world to have won relay medals.
0.121794871794872	6	With a little luck with their nerve-stretching hand-overs the relays always require a little luck the developing countries will continue the gentle redistribution of medals.
0	6	But although they have talent, few can match the strength in depth of the traditional relay powers.
0.226190476190476	6	The US 4x400m squad has been weakened by the injury to Danny Everett.
0.175925925925926	6	Even so they rested Steve Lewis, the 400m silver medallist, in last night's semi-finals.
0.117283950617284	6	In the 4x100m heats James Jett replaced Carl Lewis but Lewis ran impressively in last night's semi-final and tonight will pursue his eighth Olympic gold.
0.0753968253968254	6	One thing that became clear on Thursday, when Lewis won his seventh gold with victory in the long jump, was that while winning at the Olympics may bring other athletes excitement or relief, Lewis simply adores the experience.
0.0555555555555556	6	When Voula Patoulidou, looking up at the giant video screen after the women's 100m hurdle final, suddenly realised, to her astonishment, that she had won a gold medal, she went delightfully and utterly potty, as did the other 25 Greeks in the stadium, including Queen Sofia of Spain.
0.143939393939394	6	Lewis, on the other hand, seemed unsurprised when Mike Powell was unable to overhaul him in the long jump.
0	6	Even though the long jump had not finished and even though 5,000m runners were trudging through a semi-final, Lewis began at once an extremely hammy lap-and-a-half of honour.
0	6	He tried to orchestrate a Mexican wave.
0	6	This is a man who derives immense pleasure from winning in front of a packed house.
0	6	Lewis will be difficult to suppress tonight.
0.0791666666666667	6	Noureddine Morcelli of Algeria will be hard to beat in the men's 1,500m. Morcelli is one of five Africans in the final striving to increase their continent's tally of just three Olympic medals in this event.
0	6	Even here there is a US connection: Morcelli attended Riverside Community College in California, to hone his running on good tracks.
0	6	On Thursday night, Morcelli cruised through his heat in first place after the gentlest push on the accelerator.
0	6	The Moroccan Rachid Al-Basir followed him down the straight, a respectful step behind, looming over his fellow Arab and glancing anxiously round like a bodyguard.
0	6	Morcelli has not been beaten in the 1,500m since 1990.
0	7	Someday, Milan Bakes of Czechoslovakia might find himself the toast of Pilsen, his hometown.
0.197916666666667	7	As one of the world's finest small-bore free-rifle shooters, he is coming close.
0.0753968253968254	7	Bakes, 27, set a world record in the kneeling portion of the three-position rifle competition Friday en route to a gold medal at the 1990 World Cup USA Olympic-style shooting tournament at Petersen's Prado Tiro Ranges in Chino.
0	7	By scoring 396 of a possible 400 points, Bakes broke the record set last week in Mexico City by Yugoslavia's Rajmond Debevec.
0	7	The event includes 120 total shots in three positions prone, standing and kneeling.
0	7	Bakes once held the record for standing, too, but that was four years ago.
0	7	He has yet to hold the prone record, but his 397 in that discipline helped him take a big lead in one of three medal events Friday.
0	7	Counting the 10-shot shoot-off, Bakes finished with 1,275.9 points out of 1,309.
0	7	Jean Pierre Amat of France was second with 1,271.9.
0	7	Bakes, a lieutenant in the Czech army, said he was confident after his kneeling performance that he would do well.
0.102150537634409	7	In the day's closest competition, Francoise Decharne of Moulin, France, won the women's air rifle competition with a total of 496.4 of a possible 509.
0	7	Soon Young Jin of South Korea was second and Deena Wigger of Murray, Ky., was third.
0	7	Wigger was second after the regular competition ended, but fell 0.7 of a point behind Jin in a 10-shot final round.
0	7	All international events have added the final round to increase television and spectator interest.
0.143939393939394	7	The top eight shooters in pistol, rifle and air events qualify, whereas the top six advance in shotgun events.
0	7	In women's air pistol, Jasna Sekaric of Yugoslavia won her second gold of the four-day event with a total of 490.8.
0	7	Hyun Joo Bang of South Korea was second and Margit Stein of West Germany was third.
0	7	Sekaric, 24, held a nine-point lead going into the final round.
0	7	final was not so good," she said.
0	7	had too big of a lead.
0	7	I usually shoot better in these finals when I am pressed."
0	7	Despite her lapse, she still won by 8.4 points over Bang, perhaps the most appropriately named competitor in this tournament featuring 46 countries.
0	7	Sekaric, a secretary at a shooting club, said she has been competing for 10 years.
0	7	She won gold and bronze medals at the Seoul Olympics.
0	7	Bang, also 24, and a Seoul bank accountant, did not fare so well in 1988.
0	7	Friday was her best international performance.
0.143939393939394	8	Dave Johnson of the United States clinched the decathlon gold medal in the final event at the World University Games Sunday.
0	8	Johnson trailed Mikhail Medved of the Soviet Union by 11 points before the 1,500-meter race, the final event of the two-day competition.
0	8	the hardest I've ever worked in my life," said Johnson, of Montclair, Calif. was scared to death.
0	8	I knew I had to run at my best or even better to win."
0	8	Johnson posted a time of 4 minutes 32.72 seconds in the 1,500.
0	8	That gave him 727 points for a winning total of 8,216, 154 more than Medved.
0	8	The Soviet had a time of 4:59.60 in the race, worth 562 points, and ended up second with a total of 8,062.
0.263888888888889	8	Johnson leads the world decathlon rankings this year with 8,549 points.
0	8	always go out to give 100%, but the weather conditions stopped me from having a better score," he said.
0.243589743589744	8	Sheldon Blockburger of the U.S. was third going into the last event.
0	8	But he was overtaken by Dezso Szabo of Hungary and had to settle for fourth place at 7,906.
0	8	Szabo clinched the bronze with 8,031.
0.0931372549019608	8	felt good going into the race, but my legs just gave out," said Blockburger, who had the slowest 1,500 time and earned only 569 points in the final event.
0.186274509803922	8	Olympic steeplechase champion Julius Kariuki of Kenya, running the distance for the first time this year, won the men's 10,000-meter race, while the Romanian team earned six gold medals.
0.256756756756757	8	Four of Romania's golds came in rowing and two in track and field, one of them from Olympic champion Paula Ivan, who set a meet record in winning the women's 3,000-meter race.
0	8	Reggie Davis won the gold and Kevin Henderson took the bronze for the U.S. in the men's 400-meter intermediate hurdles.
0	8	Davis, of Tallahassee, Fla., breezed home in the hurdles in 49.74 seconds.
0	8	Vladimir Budko of the Soviet Union was a distant second in 50.30, with Henderson, of Auburn, Ala., third in 50.57.
0	8	had some problems recently with disqualifications, but this time it was OK," Davis said.
0	8	wanted this title and a meet record, but the weather spoiled my chances."
0.279411764705882	8	Kariuki, who won the gold medal at the 1988 Seoul Games in the 3,000-meter steeplechase, beat out Zeki Oeztuerk of Turkey to win the 10,000 in the slow time of 28:35.46.
0	8	ran to win and didn't worry about the time," Kariuki said.
0	8	in good condition and it's not a problem to run either the steeplechase or the 10,000."
0	8	Ivan, the Olympic 1,500-meter champion and silver medalist at 3,000 meters, won the gold in the 3,000 in 8:44.09, bettering her meet record of 8:53.61 set in 1987.
0	8	Ana Quirot of Cuba cruised to victory in the women's 400 meters in a slow 50.73, ahead of Jearl Miles of the U.S. at 52.41.
0.166666666666667	8	Quirot posted a meet record of 50.01 in Saturday's heats, fastest in the world this year.
0	8	Miles, of Jacksonville, Fla., said she tried to conserve her strength for the final 200 meters.
0	8	tried not to waste too much energy on the backstretch and concentrated on giving a big burst on the home stretch," she said.
0	8	Jaime Jefferson of Cuba won the men's long jump at 26 feet, 2 1/4 inches.
0	8	Vladimir Ratoushkov of the Soviet Union was second at 26-1 1/2, followed by Llewellyn Starks of the U.S. at 25-11 1/2.
0.143939393939394	8	Galina Astafei of Romania, the world junior champion, upset Silvia Costa of Cuba in the women's high jump.
0	8	Both cleared 6-3 1/4 but Astafei won on fewer misses.
0.316666666666667	9	The 1984 Summer Olympic Games weren't even over when advertisers began clamoring for pixie gymnast Mary Lou Retton.
0	9	She went on to grin relentlessly through some $5 million worth of commercial endorsements surely an Olympic record in itself.
0.365384615384615	9	But when the 1988 Summer Games ended Sunday night, so, too, did the chance for American athletes to follow in her footsteps.
0	9	Ad agency executives, who spend every fourth year glued to their TV sets, hoping to pick out the next star to hawk their clients' products, say that this Olympiad was a dud.
0.211111111111111	9	suspect this will go down as the dullest in the history of the Olympics," says Jerry Della Femina, chairman of ad agency Della Femina McNamee WCRS.
0	9	is the first Olympics without passion, and without passion you don't have testimonials.
0.211111111111111	9	Without heroes, you don't have anyone that anyone wants to emulate."
0.158333333333333	9	On the surface, the Games seemed to offer all the drama that usually makes for lucrative endorsement contracts.
0.287878787878788	9	Who could forget diver Greg Louganis smacking his head on the springboard, then coming back to win two gold medals?
0.5	9	Or flamboyant Florence Griffith Joyner, her two-inch fingernails raking the air as she won the 100-meter sprint?
0.2375	9	But even these two, along with Jackie Joyner-Kersee, who won the women's heptathalon and the long jump, may find it more difficult than in previous years to turn gold medals into gold in the bank.
0	9	The fact is, say many marketers, Olympic gold has lost much of its commercial luster.
0	9	don't think it's big money like it used to be," says Michael Goldberg of National Media Group Inc., the New York sports-marketing firm that represents Ms. Retton.
0	9	used to be kind of a knee-jerk reaction to do an ad campaign around an Olympic athlete.
0	9	It just doesn't happen anymore."
0	9	Certainly, this year's winning Olympians will have no trouble securing contracts from specialized sports-equipment outfitters and speaking invitations from obscure trade groups.
0	9	But the major, high-paying endorsements such as those with soft-drink companies and fast-food outlets just don't seem to be surfacing, at least not yet.
0.218390804597701	9	Earlier this year, sports marketers estimated that a gold medal won during the Summer Games could earn a personable athlete more than $1 million in endorsements.
0	9	Now, marketers say, these medalists will be lucky to pull in $100,000 to $500,000 a year.
0.186274509803922	9	Advertisers can reel off a litany of reasons why these Olympics aren't igniting much spark.
0.231707317073171	9	For one thing, they suffer by comparison with the 1984 Summer Games, so exciting because they were held in Los Angeles and because, in the absence of boycotting Soviet-bloc countries, the Americans won 83 gold medals.
0.452380952380952	9	The 1988 Games, by contrast, were broadcast from halfway around the world, and the Soviets trounced the Americans, 55 gold medals to 36.
0.162393162393162	9	What's more, marketers say, this year's drug scandals cast a pall over the Games, especially the incident involving Canadian sprinter Ben Johnson, who lost his gold medal after testing positive for steroids.
0.263888888888889	9	NBC's TV coverage also gets its share of the blame.
0	9	Marketers say it was so bland and skipped so frequently from one event to another that there was little chance for excitement to build.
0	9	The constant commercial interruptions, which led to ratings that were much lower than expected, didn't help, either.
0.172727272727273	9	During most of the past Games, was enough continuous TV coverage so that, much like a soap opera, it was possible to get involved in the lives and in the competition," says Leigh Steinberg, attorney for ice-skater Brian Boitano, a gold medalist at the 1988 Winter Games.
0	9	But not this summer, he says.
0	9	Recent changes in Olympic rules, meanwhile, have led to a glut of Olympians in search of endorsement deals.
0	9	Before the 1984 Games, most Olympic athletes weren't allowed to make commercials unless they gave up their amateur status.
0	9	Now, they can appear in as many ads as they want, but the income must go into a trust fund for training expenses.
0	9	year, more and more Olympic people are out there wanting to do commercials basically, everybody is available," says Daisy Sinclair, a vice president with ad agency Ogilvy Group Inc.
0.186274509803922	9	As a result, while once an surrounded an Olympian, now bloom is off."
0	9	Companies also are becoming more sophisticated in their approach to celebrity endorsements.
0.131944444444444	9	Increasingly cost conscious, they will no longer hook up with an Olympian just because the company president likes the athlete's sport.
0.0931372549019608	9	And after years of paying big bucks to Olympic stars only to see them fade into obscurity, companies have finally gotten the hint that Olympian fame is of the most fleeting variety.
0.0772357723577236	9	you think your phone will ring off the hook if a gold medal, it isn't going to happen anymore," says Stephen Disson, senior vice president of marketing for ProServ Inc., a Washington sports-marketing firm.
0	9	Companies now know that months from now there will be other heroes from other sporting events" for them to consider.
0.487179487179487	9	Ad agency BBDO Worldwide's attitude toward the Olympics is becoming typical.
0	9	It uses sports stars in its commercials for Pepsi Light and Oppenheimer Mutual Funds but has no plans to call on any of 1988's Olympians.
0	9	prefer to use athletes who are in the public eye on a regular basis, like football and basketball players," says Charles Miesmer, the agency's executive creative director.
0	9	like Michael Jordan have 10-plus years in their sports careers, all in a row, so I don't have to worry about the public saying, who?'"
0	9	And don't look for any of 1988's winners to start showing up on Wheaties boxes, either.
0	9	General Mills Inc., which has featured Ms. Retton and decathalon gold-medalist Bruce Jenner on its Wheaties boxes in the past, says it looks for three qualities in an endorser: career achievement, popular appeal and off-the-field accomplishments.
0	9	A spokeswoman says that none of this year's crop meet all three criteria.
0	9	So far, Ms. Joyner-Kersee has had the most visible endorsements.
0.197916666666667	9	Even before the Olympics began, she had made commercials for Primatene mist and 7-Up.
0	9	And, according to her agent, Pearl Hodge of World Class Management, she is now the process" of signing with McDonald's Corp., to work on behalf of its efforts to aid underprivileged children.
0.197916666666667	9	Ms. Joyner-Kersee's sister-in-law, Ms. Griffith Joyner, may soon take the endorsement lead.
0.27536231884058	9	Advertisers say with her good looks and fashion flare, she is attracting more interest than any of the other medal winners.
0.395833333333333	9	Another Olympian with endorsement potential is swimmer Matt Biondi, who won five gold medals.
0	9	Mr. Biondi has already signed a swim-wear contract with Arena USA Inc., and Parkes Brittain, his agent at Advantage International Inc., says his client definitely be in a high-income ring, the highest you can name."
0	9	Then there is Mr. Louganis.
0.301587301587302	9	Since winning two gold medals during the 1984 Summer Olympics, the diver has had little luck with major endorsements.
0	9	And a few marketing executives say that even his second sweep of the diving events may not up his potential.
0.102150537634409	9	most advertisers are looking for the male hero, the word trails along very closely," says Marty Blackman of Blackman Raber, a sports-marketing firm in New York.
0	9	don't find Louganis a macho guy."
0	9	Still, other marketing professionals say that Mr. Louganis's dramatic recovery after smashing his head has secured the diver's future.
0	9	His manager, Jim Babbitt, won't comment on any contract offers.
0	9	He will say, however, that his client has just fine.
0	9	He isn't unhappy.
0	9	He dives to perform; he doesn't dive for dollars."

0	8	Whatever's needed will be done.
0.571428571428571	8	President Bush declared Huntsville a disaster area, but FEMA may have to do some financial juggling to deal with this year's rash of natural disasters.
0	8	Parts of eight states have been declared eligible for federal relief.
0	8	Any one disaster like Hugo or the earthquake in California exceeds what we have in a normal year alone, Peterson said.
0	8	Congress provided $1.1 billion in supplemental funds to FEMA after Hugo devastated the Caribbean and the East Coast in September, and $1.2 billion following the earthquake that ravaged parts of northern California on Oct. 17.
0	8	So far, about $1.3 billion has been allocated to disaster victims.

0	8	If everything works well, in seven to 10 days we should get the first checks out, Peterson said Friday.

0	8	The state will have to ante up 25 percent of the cost of providing clothing and temporary housing for tornado victims, with the federal government pitching in the other 75 percent.
0	8	Gov. Hunt said he expected the Alabama Legislature to come up with whatever money is needed.
0.296296296296296	8	The state doesn't budget for disasters, said Danny Cooper, Alabama's emergency management director.
0	8	We take care of them at the time.
0	8	Hunt stressed that government agencies won't be able to shoulder the entire load.
0	8	He requested donations to agencies such as the American Red Cross, which set up a shelter for the homeless as rescue workers dug through the rubble in those desperate hours after the tornado struck.
0.183908045977011	8	The tornado hit Huntsville with devastating force winds were estimated at 250 mph and virtually no warning about 4:30 p.m. Wednesday, leaving a 10-mile-long path of destruction.

0	8	I woke up a different person this morning.
0.115942028985507	8	Officials said several truckloads of food have rolled into Huntsville but the city is running out of places to store the goods.
0	8	There's a sense of thankfulness, Hunt said.
0	8	It's heartwarming to see how people have come together.
0	8	Huntsville is home to NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center, the Army's Redstone Arsenal and a number of high-tech industries.
0.156862745098039	8	Mayor Steve Hettinger said the city would be able to withstand the tornado's financial impact.
0	8	Huntsville has a strong economy, a diverse economy, he said.
0	8	That's not the source of our concern.

0	2	I know miracles can happen.
0	2	Marcos supporters, meanwhile, announced they would hold rallies Saturday to pray for his recovery.
0	2	Pro-Marcos leaders warned the former president's death in exile would trigger demonstrations.
0	2	We expect tactical alliances in this nationwide mass action, said pro-Marcos lawyer Oliver Lozano.

0.357142857142857	3	President Corazon Aquino of the Philippines on Monday asked government and industrial leaders to expand economic ties with her nation.
0	3	Mrs. Aquino, on the first stop of her weeklong three-nation European tour, met with West German President Richard von Weizsaecker, Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher and other officials.
0.0735294117647059	3	Mrs. Aquino, comparing the task of strengthening the heavily indebted Philippine economy to the recovery of West Germany after World War II, asked that Germany share its experience with her homeland.
0	3	We have tried by sound fiscal policies not to buy recovery at the price of inflation, nor debt relief at the price of national honor, she said in a speech to the West German Chamber of Industry and Trade.
0	3	We have paid as careful attention to the consequences of runaway inflation and devaluation as Germany in the light of her own experiences between the wars, she said.
0.192307692307692	3	Mrs. Aquino said the Philippines' debt was projected to increase to $29 billion by year's end but that much was money that was in fact stolen by the previous government of ousted dictator Ferdinand Marcos.
0.0694444444444444	3	She said that since her government took over in 1986, the country's growth rate of minus 10 percent under Marcos in 1985 had improved to a rate of plus 6.7 percent by 1988.
0.104166666666667	3	What we need to complete the equation are two elements essential to the German recovery debt relief and investments, Mrs. Aquino said.
0.2	3	During a state banquet in the evening, Weizsaecker told Mrs. Aquino her visit would further strengthen relations between West Germany and the Philippines.
0.0657894736842105	3	Weizsaecker said the Philippines have had good results in trade with West Germany, and assured Mrs. Aquino that the barrier-free market the European Economic Community plans for 1992 will not lock out trade with other countries.
0	3	Mrs. Aquino, who arrived in West Germany on Sunday, will meet with Chancellor Helmut Kohl on Tuesday before departing for Paris.
0	3	She also is to visit Belgium.
0.333333333333333	4	The resignation of the land reform secretary raises doubts about President Corazon Aquino's commitment to agrarian reform and dramatizes conflicts in a government criticized for lack of vision.
0.0892857142857143	4	The controversy climaxed Thursday with the resignation of Secretary-designate Florencio Abad, 35, whose nomination was opposed by the pro-Aquino Struggle of the Democratic Filipino Party.
0	4	Handling of the controversy highlighted all the inconsistencies for which Mrs. Aquino has been criticized: lack of clear priorities; tactical blundering; and the strong influence of her relatives over national policy.
0.0581395348837209	4	It also reinforced the suspicion among liberals that for all her rhetoric, Mrs. Aquino does not share the deep commitment to social change which they expected when she took power in the 1986 people power uprising against the late Ferdinand Marcos.
0.125	4	The sincerity of Corazon Aquino is being seriously questioned, wrote columnist Ninez Cacho-Olivares in the Philippine Daily Inquirer.
0	4	Land reform, the centerpiece program of her administration, is dead.
0	4	Abad's troubles began in February when he tried unsuccessfully to block the lease of government land in Cavite province to Japan's Marubeni Corp., for an industrial park.
0.161290322580645	4	Although the deal was approved by the National Development Corp., Abad, a former congressman, said the land should be distributed to peasants under the agrarian reform program.
0.104166666666667	4	The Department of Trade and Industry said the Marubeni deal was crucial to attracting much-needed foreign investment for the government's industrialization program.
0	4	But the Department of Agrarian Reform said if the Cavite land was exempted, hundreds of landlords would try to have their property declared as a potential industrial site to avoid losing title.
0	4	The presidential staff finally worked out a compromise under which farmers would be offered either land or a cash settlement.
0	4	Abad reluctantly agreed to the formula under repeated orders from Mrs. Aquino.
0	4	Abad's firm stand, however, alarmed landowners in Congress, who floated rumors in the press that the Agrarian Reform Department was riddled with Communists.
0	4	Lawmakers on the Commission on Appointments who belong to the pro-Aquino Struggle of the Democratic Filipino Party blocked Abad's confirmation through eight hearings until he finally resigned.
0	4	Despite the party's victory, poltical damage to it and Mrs. Aquino was considerable.
0	4	The Manila press transformed Abad into a folk hero, depicting him as the champion of the farmer against political barons of the Struggle of the Democratic Filipino Party, dubbed Landlord-Dominated Party.
0	4	Worry not about Abad's destiny, Mrs. President, wrote columnist Carol Arguillas in The Manila Chronicle.
0	4	Worry about yours and how you blew the last chance for liberal support.
0	4	Mrs. Aquino pledged publicly to work for Abad's confirmation, but her lobbying appeared ineffectual.
0	4	Abad's strongest opponents included politicians who consistently support Mrs. Aquino, leading to speculation she was not disappointed when he departed.
0.25	4	Abad's opponents included her younger brother, Rep. Jose Peping Cojuangco, who wields considerable influence in government.
0	4	There is no way Cory Aquino will challenge Peping, said one Western diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity.
0	4	Mrs. Aquino comes from a landlord family.
0	4	She and her brothers and sisters are partners in a 14,500-acre sugar plantation in Tarlac province.
0	4	Rather than break up the estate, they used a legal option and created a profit-sharing plan for the tenants.
0.0961538461538462	4	The Abad controversy was the latest in a series of blows to the agrarian reform program, once touted as the centerpiece of the administration.
0	4	Last year, Agrarian Reform Secretary Philip Juico resigned after disclosures that his department paid vastly inflated sums for marginal land.
0	4	His successor, Miriam Defensor Santiago, was repeatedly rejected by the Commission on Appointments, only to be reappointed until Mrs. Aquino replaced her with Abad on Dec. 31.
0	4	No reason for the change was given.
0.113636363636364	4	But Mrs. Santiago claims she did not display sufficient public loyalty to Mrs. Aquino during a coup attempt in early December.
0.104166666666667	4	Agrarian reform was widely seen as a means for breaking the power of landlord families and uplifting the livelihood of millions of peasants.
0	4	The program was advertised as essential in curbing the 21-year-old rural-based Marxist insurgency.
0	4	Mrs. Aquino proclaimed a land reform program in 1987 but left details to Congress.
0.113636363636364	4	The final bill contained so many pro-landlord loopholes that several of its original sponsors, including Abad, voted against it.
0	4	Robert H. Reid has been the AP bureau chief in Manila since September 1986.
0.714285714285714	5	President Corazon Aquino today reversed a long-held policy and said she was willing to negotiate cease-fires with Communist guerrillas and former soldiers who have staged coup attempts.
0.227272727272727	5	Mrs. Aquino also invited the opposition to join the talks, including her most outspoken critic, Sen. Juan Ponce Enrile.
0	5	Manila has been rocked by almost daily explosions.
0.166666666666667	5	Although no one has claimed responsibility for the blasts, the government has blamed them on former soldiers who have repeatedly tried to toppled Mrs. Aquino in coup attempts.
0	5	The Communist rebels have been waging a 21-year rebellion to establish a Marxist state.
0	5	The last cease-fire with them collapsed in early 1987.
0.15625	5	Sen. Wigberto Tanada called for a truce between the government and the Communist rebels after a major earthquake in the Philippines on July 16, but Mrs. Aquino rejected the proposal.
0	5	On Tuesday, a pro-Aquino senator, Orlando Mercado, urged Mrs. Aquino to put aside differences with her political foes and begin to discuss the nation's security problems and economic woes.
0.258620689655172	5	Enrile said he was willing to reconcile with Mrs. Aquino, who fired him as defense minister after he was implicated in a coup attempt in November 1986.
0.0961538461538462	5	Mrs. Aquino said in a statement today that Mercado and Enrile are welcome to join discussions now being held by a committee of Cabinet members.
0.0862068965517241	5	Defense Secretary Fidel Ramos has adamantly refused any cease-fire with the Communist guerrillas since November 1986 when the Aquino government negotiated with the rebels during a 60-day truce.
0.119047619047619	5	Ramos, a member of the Cabinet committee, has been credited with crushing six coup attempts against Mrs. Aquino.
0.0961538461538462	5	Communists have accused him of whipping up threats of another coup attempt against Mrs. Aquino so that the civilian leadership would become indebted to him.
0	5	Ramos has denied all allegations.
0.1	5	The last cease-fire with the rebels collapsed in January 1987 after troops fired on farmers demonstrating outside Mrs. Aquino's office for land reform.
0.7	6	President Corazon Aquino said Friday that for security reasons she would not permit deposed President Ferdinand E. Marcos to be buried in the Philippines.
0	6	Marcos was reported to be in critical condition" in Honolulu, where he has lived in exile since his ouster in 1986.
0	6	Hospital officials there said that he rallied slightly Friday but remained in extremely critical condition.
0	6	The 71-year-old former president has been suffering from heart, lung and kidney disorders as well as pneumonia.
0.0757575757575758	6	His frail body attached to a respirator and a hemodialysis blood-cleansing machine, Marcos is unconscious most of the time but occasionally shows faint signs of life, doctors in Hawaii said.
0	6	Medical sources said that he is being treated with antibiotics and heart medication but that he could die at time."
0	6	Radio stations here broadcast hourly reports on Marcos' condition.
0.277777777777778	6	Philippine officials were asked repeatedly whether the Aquino government's refusal to allow Marcos to return to the country would remain in effect after his death.
0.214285714285714	6	One radio station broadcast an interview with Marcos' wife, Imelda, at the St. Francis Medical Center in Honolulu, where she was said to be maintaining a vigil at his bedside.
0.25	6	She was quoted as appealing to Aquino to her heart" and allow Marcos to return to the Philippines.
0.277777777777778	6	Aquino said she would not alter her position but that she had prayed for Marcos' recovery.
0	6	regret to inform Mrs. Marcos that as much as I agree that Mr. Marcos has his rights, I still have to consider also the rights and the interests of millions of Filipinos," Aquino told reporters at the presidential palace.

0.416666666666667	6	Nonetheless, Marcos supporters announced that they will march through the capital today to support the former president's demand that he be allowed to die in the Philippines.
0.0925925925925926	6	Despite charges that Marcos and his inner circle looted the government treasury of billions of dollars, the former president still has a significant following here.
0.208333333333333	6	In the Philippines, personal loyalty is considered a sacred debt.
0.125	6	Government officials have accused Marcos supporters of taking part in at least two attempted coups against the Aquino government.
0.3	6	Aquino evidently is concerned that even after death, the return of Marcos' remains could spark violence or galvanize opposition to her government.
0.0757575757575758	6	Aquino's national security adviser, Rafael Ileto, told reporters Friday that the Philippine army is prepared for any emergency that might be provoked by the death of the former president.
0.208333333333333	6	He was quoted as saying that while Marcos is no longer a threat to the government, his supporters still cause disruption."
0.0833333333333333	6	Marcos' mother, Josefa, died a year ago, but because Marcos has been barred from this country, the family refuses to have her remains interred.
0	6	A newspaper advertisement published on the first anniversary of her death May 4 said, arrangements will be announced."
0.1	6	Marcos and his wife have been indicted by a federal grand jury in the United States on charges of racketeering, fraud and extortion.
0	6	Marcos has been excused from appearing in court up to now because of his failing health.
0	6	Imelda Marcos is free on $5 million bail.

0.303030303030303	7	The quick collapse of a bizarre military revolt on the Philippines' second-largest island leaves President Corazon Aquino's beleaguered government with a muddied victory at best and clear danger signs ahead.
0.0581395348837209	7	Analysts here say Aquino's immediate use of small bombers and artillery to end a pocket rebellion led by renegade army Col. Alexander Noble on the north coast of Mindanao helps counter oft-heard criticism that her four-year-old government is indecisive and inept.
0.208333333333333	7	And despite widespread fears that the Oct. 4-6 uprising would quickly spread to military garrisons on other islands and become a major threat to Aquino, leaders of the rightist military underground failed to move.

0	7	sort of fizzled before anything could happen."
0.166666666666667	7	But he and other diplomats see little benefit for Aquino's battered image overseas.
0.384615384615385	7	international consequence is people saying, another revolt in the Philippines.'
0	7	It's like she's under a perpetual onslaught," he said.
0	7	Moreover, questions linger as to how Noble and about 350 rebel troops so easily evaded a much-publicized military manhunt to drive 140 miles from their mountain sanctuary, pass unhindered through at least 10 military checkpoints and seize two military camps, including the command post of the general who had been ordered to capture him all without firing a shot.
0.0806451612903226	7	Noble, once chief of staff of Aquino's own security detail, quickly linked up with Reuben Canoy, a local politician who heads the so-called Mindanao Independence Movement.
0	7	The resource-rich island has spawned secession groups since the 16th Century though Canoy's is the first to print fake passports and currency based on crude counterfeits of U.S. $5 bills.
0	7	whole thing was kind of a farce," one Asian diplomat said.

0	7	Noble, best known for his long goatee and red stocking cap, quickly surrendered with most of his motley army of soldiers and Higaonon tribal militiamen after two World War II-vintage T-28 planes, called Tora Toras here, bombed and strafed one of the camps.
0	7	One plane later crashed and the pilot drowned, the revolt's only fatality.
0.833333333333333	7	Aquino has now survived two major coup attempts and half a dozen assorted and aborted military mutinies.
0	7	Most ended in embarrassing standoffs or dragged on for days, as top military leaders hedged on ordering troops to fire on other soldiers.
0	7	In one case, mutineers were ordered to do push-ups and attend Bible class as punishment.

0.108695652173913	7	After the revolt, the government toughened its anti-coup law, boosting the maximum penalty from 12 years to life in prison.
0.125	7	Aquino's spokesman, Tomas Gomez III, urged other rebel leaders to take honorable way out" suicide.
0.0657894736842105	7	Ironically, Noble made his move on the day a presidential fact-finding board issued a long-awaited 609-page report on the causes of last December's coup attempt in Manila, which left more than 100 people dead.
0.078125	7	After 332 witnesses, 226 sworn statements and 4,100 documents, the so-called Davide Commission concluded that coup attempts are likely to continue but unlikely to succeed for the indefinite future.
0.0806451612903226	7	Commission member Delfin Lazaro estimated that 70 officers involved in last December's coup attempt, which came closest to toppling Aquino, are still at large and still plotting.

0	7	What else can they do?"
0.256410256410256	8	As a military coup attempt unfolded in their homeland 7,000 miles away, supporters of the rebellious soldiers engaged in a shouting match Thursday night with supporters of President Corazon Aquino at the Philippine Consulate in Los Angeles.
0	8	About 30 members of the Filipino-American Movement for a Better Philippines held a candlelight vigil outside the consulate on Wilshire Boulevard to express sympathy with the coup led by officers linked to renegade Lt. Col. Gregorio Honasan.
0	8	are calling for Mrs. Aquino to step down immediately," said Milo Castelo, 45, a Los Angeles attorney.
0	8	He said the Aquino government is and incompetent" and guilty of corruption."
0	8	Castelo and a handful of the protesters then entered the office building and took the elevator to the 12th-floor consulate, where a coalition of four Filipino groups in Los Angeles that support the Aquino government had just completed a press conference.
0.0925925925925926	8	Half a dozen television news crews watched as the anti-government protesters confronted the acting consul general for the Philippines in Los Angeles, Willy C. Gaa.

0	8	announced Eli Swing, 49, a Los Angeles real estate agent.
0	8	The consul general remained silent, glaring at the protesters.
0.441176470588235	8	But Danny Lamila, a representative of the Philippines Liberal Party, loudly defended the government.
0	8	people staging the coup are criminals," Lamila yelled.
0	8	are fugitives from justice!"
0	8	After a few minutes, the 20 Aquino supporters in the room began chanting
0	8	The anti-government protesters then left the consular offices and order was restored.
0.0862068965517241	8	Greg Santillas of the Campaign for Democracy and Independence said he believes that most of the estimated 350,000 Filipinos living in Los Angeles County oppose the military coup.

0.227272727272727	9	Philippine Vice President and opposition leader Salvador H. Laurel declined Saturday night to condemn the armed insurrection in his country and said the rebels the right" to try to seize power.
0.357142857142857	9	Laurel also said that the rebels will not surrender to President Corazon Aquino's forces, as she has demanded.
0	9	He predicted that the fighting may turn to civil war if reported rebel reinforcements arrive from Cebu, Mindanao and other islands.
0	9	don't think this is going to end right away," he said in a suite in the Peninsula Hotel here.
0	9	think it's going to be a long, protracted thing, even civil war."
0	9	Although he grinned broadly and laughed often during the interview, Laurel denied that he was for the rebels.
0.294117647058823	9	He refused, however, to condemn their use of violence against a constitutionally elected government.
0	9	don't want to prejudge their goals or objectives," he said.
0	9	should try to win with a ballot rather than a bullet," he added.
0	9	democracy does not preclude that as a last resort."
0	9	Laurel, who is known as Doy, broke with Aquino shortly after they took office in 1986 following a popular uprising that toppled former President Ferdinand E. Marcos.
0	9	Since then, Laurel has criticized Aquino frequently in his role as head of the opposition Nacionalista Party.
0	9	Laurel said he was in London early Friday when the Philippine fighting began.
0.0735294117647059	9	He flew to Hong Kong but was stranded here with scores of journalists because the Philippines' two international airports, in Manila and Cebu, have been closed since the fighting began.
0	9	Laurel said 18 Nacionalista leaders were meeting at the Intercontinental Hotel in Manila late Saturday despite the presence of rebel holdouts in the hotel.
0	9	He called the group his party's but said they have no ties to the rebels.
0	9	Laurel criticized Aquino for asking the United States to help bolster her beleaguered forces Friday.
0	9	U.S. officials have said F-4 Phantom jets flew over rebel aircraft to keep them grounded but did not drop bombs or fire.
0	9	But Laurel said the U.S. fighter-bombers destroyed a Philippine air force fuel dump and other facilities at Sangley Point and fired rockets that killed civilians near Camp Aguinaldo, the armed forces headquarters.
0	9	Laurel added that Aquino now is beholden" to the United States just as exploratory talks on renegotiating leases for Clark Air Base and Subic Bay Naval Base, the two largest U.S. military facilities abroad, are beginning.
0	9	Laurel's companion, Homobono Adaza, a former member of Parliament under Marcos and a Nacionalista member, also defended the rebels.

0	1	There was no warning, Ney said.
0	1	Rescuers pulled people from three cars in Wegee Creek, which flows through Shadyside and into the Ohio River, said Badia.

0	1	We had 3.5 inches of rain in a two-hour period last night.
0	1	Most of the problems in West Virginia were confined to road closures and basement flooding.
0.0515873015873016	1	At least 25 people were evacuated during the night in the Pittsburgh suburb of Etna, where some homes had up to 5 feet of water in their basements, said borough manager Bill Skertich.
0	1	They returned to their homes Friday.
0	1	Landslides were reported in the Pittsburgh area, and many city streets were closed during the storm.
0.168831168831169	1	The flooding was more serious in Licking County, Ohio.

0	1	Flood waters in most areas had subsided by Thursday night, according to authorities.
0.0530612244897959	2	Cement blocks were all that remained of homes, fallen branches stood where trees used to be and muddy streams meandered through the outskirts of this Ohio River town after a furious flash flood.
0	2	Residents donned shorts and hip-waders Friday to begin putting their lives back together after 5{ inches of rain fell in 3{ hours late Thursday, churning floodwaters that left at least 11 people dead and 51 others missing early today.
0	2	The shock had not worn off, said police officer Bruce Fink, whose bristly face bore signs of more than 20 hours on duty, including work at a temporary morgue set up at a funeral home.
0	2	We have counselors back there now, but we've lost whole families.
0	2	It's just been devastating, he said Friday night.
0.0773809523809524	2	Fink said he feared there wouldn't be enough funeral homes to handle the dead in this eastern Ohio town of 4,300 people.
0.185714285714286	2	Allan Hans called the flooding the devil's work.
0	2	I lost everything but my car and the clothes I'm wearing, he said.
0	2	Hans said he was sitting in his trailer when he heard a branch crack and went to check out the noise.
0	2	He saw rushing water, ran to tell neighbors and moved his car.
0.30952380952381	2	The trailer was swept away by the time he returned home.
0	2	John and Sue Wright, whose home rests on the banks of Pipe Creek, estimated they lost about $20,000 worth of property.
0	2	I was one of the lucky ones.
0	2	What I lost, I can replace, Wright said.
0	2	Although it was the center of rescue operations, downtown Shadyside suffered no apparent flood damage.
0	2	But it was a different story on the outskirts of town, in the heart of Ohio's richest coal fields.
0	2	Cars were mired roof-deep in mud, and guardrails and chunks of concrete were torn from roads.
0.206349206349206	2	A 20-foot, 18-inch thick beam that held a sign leading to 3K's Bar near Pipe Creek was twisted like a pretzel by the force of what witnesses described as a wall of water.
0	2	People moved rubble and made makeshift repairs to bridges that span McMann Creek, which links homes to Ohio Route 147.
0.30952380952381	2	Many bridges were washed away.
0	2	Small tractors and four-wheel-drive vehicles were the only means of transportation in much of the stricken area.
0.163865546218487	2	At least 170 members of the Ohio National Guard were called in to patrol and to help rebuild flood-swept roads, said Stacie Gilg, a spokeswoman for the Ohio Emergency Management Agency.
0	2	Disasters always bring out the curious, and this was no exception.
0	2	By Friday night, traffic jammed Ohio Route 7, which skirts the Ohio River and is the main north-south road through town.
0	2	Belmont County Sheriff Tom McCort said he suspected many of the vehicles belonged to sightseers.
0	2	McCort said there were no serious attempts at looting.
0	2	He said he was pleased with the assistance of young people.
0.0928571428571429	2	One young man turned in a strongbox filled with valuable coins lost in the flood, the sheriff said.
0	2	The kid handed me this box and it was unlocked, McCort said.
0	2	It really made me feel good.
0.0546218487394958	3	The mother of a 12-year-old girl swept away by a flash flood was clinging to hope that her daughter was alive but perhaps unable to get home, a family friend said Saturday.
0.214285714285714	3	Janice Trigg's daughter, Kerri, was among nearly three dozen still missing Saturday night, two days after the floods hit eastern Ohio.
0	3	She keeps saying Kerri Jo may have amnesia, or she can't move to get help.
0	3	That's a mother's hope, said the friend, Betty Kreiter, 67.
0	3	Searchers for the missing used trained dogs to sniff through the rubble and along the banks of the Wegee and Pipe creeks, which empty into the Ohio River, in an effort that stretched five miles south of this town.
0	3	Workers also sifted through debris that collected at the Hannibal locks and dam on the Ohio River, about 25 miles south.
0	3	Relatives of the missing were staying with friends and family, said the Rev. Robert Gracey, who was counseling flood victims at a school turned into a relief center.
0.0807453416149068	3	Kerri had been playing at a friend's house when the one-story home suddenly was washed away in the flood Thursday night.
0.0476190476190476	3	The friend, 9-year-old Amber Colvin, was swept down Wegee Creek and into the Ohio River, but survived a seven-mile ordeal by clinging to logs.Amber was released from a hospital Saturday after treatment for minor injuries.
0	3	She said she last saw Kerri when the two, alone in the house, jumped into a bathtub for safety in the storm.
0	3	The tub was washed into the creek.
0	3	Throughout the town, there were stories of fear, luck and close calls.
0	3	Deanna Hulderman, 48, said she and her husband, Clancey, were pulled under by Wegee Creek flood water at a bar but were reunited about a half-hour later.
0.0742857142857143	3	Mrs. Hulderman said she, her husband and about seven others were in the 3Ks bar when a wall collapsed and water rushed through.
0.168831168831169	3	I saw my husband go under and get washed away.
0	3	He was yelling how much he loved me, and then I went under, Mrs. Hulderman said.
0.0599078341013825	3	I began praying don't let me die like this,' and the next thing I knew I was standing on my feet, and the water went down.
0.103174603174603	3	Mrs. Hulderman said firefighters rescued her husband at the mouth of the creek near the Ohio River.
0.0844155844155844	3	Capt. James Boling of the Ohio National Guard said local authorities told him some of the bar patrons remained unaccounted for.
0	3	Kathy Schramm, 37, said she, her husband and their two children fled their two-story house before water washed through.
0	3	When they returned, the basement and first floor were flooded, and the surrounding area looked like a big lake.
0.0714285714285714	3	I looked up at a house on the hill, and it looked like it was on stilts on the water, Mrs. Schramm said.
0.464285714285714	4	The death toll from flash floods that swept through a rural area of eastern Ohio rose to 20 Sunday as searchers dug along two creeks and dived into the Ohio River.
0	4	Sixteen people remained missing.
0.0928571428571429	4	Workers used shovels and picks to dig along the creek banks, and sifted through debris at places marked with red flags, where search dogs indicated they'd detected human scents, said National Guard Capt. Jim Boling.
0.168831168831169	4	Divers worked where the two creeks empty into the Ohio.
0	4	Four bodies were found Sunday.
0	4	But two of those were not immediately identified, and the list of missing was not revised to account for them.
0.0386904761904762	4	The number missing dropped to 16 with the other two bodies and the removal of two other names: a woman who called to say she was safe and a person who authorities weren't sure lived in the area, said coroner's investigator Chuck Vogt.
0.0714285714285714	4	The 20th victim was pulled from the mouth of Pipe Creek at the Ohio River, about seven miles south of Shadyside, Vogt said.
0.0807453416149068	4	Another body was found in debris along Wegee Creek, and two bodies were found earlier in the Ohio, he said.
0.218487394957983	4	That brought the confirmed death toll in Thursday's floods to 20, including five children.
0.397959183673469	4	Twenty-three dog teams from four states were searching for victims, said Boling.
0	4	The digging will continue at least through Tuesday, said Fire Chief Mark Badia.
0	4	The thing you find once you start into these brush piles and piles of trees are cars, and they have to be torn apart and searched separately, Badia said.
0.206349206349206	4	Everything you turn up creates a different situation.
0	4	But Vogt said he doubted many of the missing would be found alive.
0	4	It's just been too long.
0	4	I don't think there's anybody alive out there, he said.
0	4	You can't swim out there that long in the Ohio River.
0.0742857142857143	4	The Wegee and Pipe creeks overflowed Thursday night during storms that poured 5{ inches of rain onto eastern Ohio in 3{ hours.
0.247619047619048	4	The floods destroyed as many as 70 houses and damaged up to 40 others.
0.142857142857143	4	Authorities said Friday that 60 people were missing; some of those were later found dead, while others notified authorities that they were safe.
0.116071428571429	4	Officials also learned that some of those feared missing had moved out of the area.
0	4	Officials were comparing county property lists and data from the Census Bureau with information from residents and relatives, Boling said.
0	4	Investigators Sunday blamed the flash floods on an unusually heavy rainstorm that overwhelmed the designed flow capacities of threebridges over the creeks.
0	4	Badia said rainwater running down hillsides forced debris into the creeks, forming dams at each bridge.
0.696428571428572	4	The dams broke under the water pressure.
0	4	Eventually the bridges couldn't hold any more.
0.0928571428571429	4	The debris broke loose, and that's when we got three big gushes of water, he said.
0.206349206349206	4	As rescue efforts continued, the National Guard cleared roads and bridges leading into the stricken area.
0	4	Eighteen Ohio counties have been declared federal disaster areas since tornadoes and flooding first struck May 25.
0	4	Across the border in West Virginia, Gov. Gaston Caperton said Sunday he had no precise dollar figure on damage from flooding Friday along a five-mile stretch near New Martinsville and in nearby Ohio County, but estimated it will run into millions of dollars.
0	4	No deaths or serious injuries were reported.
0	4	Caperton toured flooded areas in Wheeling and the Doolin Run community near New Martinsville.
0	4	He said he saw tremendous devastation to hundreds of houses, house trailers and cars.
0	4	State Public Safety Secretary Joseph Skaff estimated that repairing and replaceing bridges and roads will cost about $750,000.
0.232142857142857	4	National Guard soldiers helped with cleanup Sunday.
0.238095238095238	5	The death toll from last week's flash floods mounted to 21 today when a body was found in the Ohio River, and authorities said there was little hope for the 14 people still listed as missing.
0	5	It's just been too long.
0	5	I don't think there's anybody alive out there.
0	5	You can't swim out there that long in the Ohio River, said Chuck Vogt, Belmont County coroner's investigator.
0.30952380952381	5	The search for the missing was suspended briefly this morning when a thunderstorm rolled through the area.
0.222857142857143	5	Heavy rain fell for about 45 minutes, swelling Wegee Creek, one of two creeks that overflowed in Thursday night's flash flood.
0.0773809523809524	5	By midmorning, the muddy creek was nearly crossing a road about three miles upstream from where the floods inflicted the most damage.
0.0928571428571429	5	Lt. Dean Irvin of the Ohio Army National Guard said there were no immediate reports of additional property damage.
0.0562770562770563	5	The body found this morning was in the Ohio River near Moundsville, W.Va., about 10 miles south of Shadyside, according to Chuck Vogt, Belmont County coroner's investigator.
0	5	The number of names on the list of missing dropped from 18 to 14 with the identities of three victims and a call by one person alerting authorities that she was safe, Vogt said.
0	5	One of the recovered bodies remains unidentified.
0.103174603174603	5	Authorities are not ruling out the possibility that other people not on the list could be missing.
0	5	Four bodies were recovered Sunday.
0.0977443609022556	5	Officials said Friday that 60 people were missing; some of those later were found dead, while others notified authorities that they were safe and officials learned that still more had moved out of the area.
0	5	Wegee and Pipe creeks overflowed during storms that dumped 5{ inches of rain in 3{ hours.
0.247619047619048	5	The floods destroyed as many as 70 houses and damaged up to 40 others.
0.25615763546798	5	Most of those whose homes and belongings were swept away by the wall of water will have to put their lives back together largely without benefit of insurance.
0.0619047619047619	5	Few people in the coal-mining and steel-making area carried flood insurance, and homeowners' insurance will not cover damage from Thursday's flood, residents and insurers said.
0.168831168831169	5	We didn't think we needed to have flood insurance.
0	5	That creek never flooded.
0	5	Everybody just got wiped out, said Julia Kulazenka.
0.0742857142857143	5	Rainwater running down hillsides had forced debris into the creeks and formed dams at bridges spanning them, Shadyside Fire Chief Mark Badia said.
0	5	Eventually the bridges couldn't hold any more.
0.0928571428571429	5	The debris broke loose, and that's when we got three big gushes of water, Badia said.
0	5	The home Mrs. Kulazenka shared with her husband until his death last July was damaged as Wegee Creek raged out of control.
0	5	She said replacing a machine shop, garage, deck and automobiles she and her son owned would cost more than $80,000.
0	5	They told us homeowners' won't do us no good.
0	5	So unless the government helps us rebuild, I don't know what I'll do with this place, Mrs. Kulazenka said.
0.704433497536946	5	The Federal Emergency Management Agency said it will open an office Tuesday in Shadyside to accept applications from residents for low-interest loans and grants to help them rebuild.
0.0844155844155844	5	Before the flood, land in the Wegee Creek valley fetched handsome prices, said Kulazenka's son, Charles Kulazenka.
0	5	That was especially welcome to residents, many of whom were either retired or laid off from jobs in coal mines in Belmont County, where unemployment in April was 6.8 percent.
0	5	Ground was at a premium down here before this because it was just outside the city limits
0.103174603174603	5	It was quiet and peaceful and people were looking to buy and build new homes out here.
0	5	Now, you couldn't give it away, Kulazenka said.
0	5	But we can't be bitter, though, because we've got our lives, and a lot of our neighbors, real close buddies, weren't that lucky.
0.412698412698413	6	A flash flood sent a wall of water 15 to 20 feet high rampaging through hill communities along the Ohio River, killing at least 10 people and leaving dozens missing, authorities said today.
0.0687830687830688	6	Two creeks just outside this Ohio River village of 4,300 residents overflowed when thunderstorms dumped about 4 inches of rain Thursday night in about an hour.
0.65546218487395	6	created a wall of water," said Jim Williams of the Ohio Emergency Management Agency.
0	6	problem we're having right now is accounting for the people we can't find."
0	6	Williams said 40 to 60 people were unaccounted for at midday.
0	6	Belmont County's sheriff's Sgt. Bart Giesey said 10 people were confirmed dead.
0.928571428571429	6	Gov. Richard F. Celeste declared a state of emergency and surveyed the area.
0.30952380952381	6	The raging waters knocked homes off their foundations and washed away a bar filled with people in Shadyside, an Appalachian foothill town.
0	6	The Shadyside Fire Department set up a command center at the Jefferson Elementary School to coordinate rescue efforts.
0.13265306122449	6	Command center spokeswoman Karen Bovek said officials had no complete death toll figure.
0.412698412698413	6	Authorities were searching for victims in rural areas.

0.218487394957983	6	Acting Mayor James Amato said the storms created a deluge that knocked homes off their foundations.
0	6	are a lot of trailers out in this area that got hit," he said.
0.142857142857143	6	Belmont County Sheriff's Department spokeswoman Judy Phillips said a Shadyside bar full of people was washed away when water caved in the back wall.
0	6	Two people were accounted for, she said.
0	6	But she could offer no estimate of how many were in the bar.
0	6	Shadyside Fire Chief Mark Badia said rescuers pulled people from three cars in Wegee Creek, which flows through Shadyside and into the Ohio River.
0	6	don't know how to describe it you've got to see it to believe it," Badia said.
0	6	There also was flooding in Jefferson County, north of Belmont, and Licking County in central Ohio.
0	6	About 200 residents were evacuated from their homes in central Ohio after 3 inches of rain fell in an hour, flooding streets and washing out rural roads.
0.290178571428571	7	The death toll from flash floods that swept through a rural area of eastern Ohio increased to 19 Sunday as searchers dug along two creeks and dived into the Ohio River.
0	7	Eighteen people remained missing.
0.0928571428571429	7	Workers used shovels and picks to dig along the creek banks, and sifted through debris at places marked with red flags, where search dogs indicated they had detected human scents, National Guard Capt. Jim Boling said.
0.168831168831169	7	Divers worked where the two creeks empty into the Ohio.
0	7	One body was found Sunday in debris along Wegee Creek, about three miles from where it meets the river, said Belmont County coroner's investigator Chuck Vogt.
0.0742857142857143	7	Another was pulled from the Ohio near a bridge at Moundsville, W. Va., about 10 miles south of Shadyside, he said.

An earthquake of magnitude 7.7 hit northwestern Iran on June 21 , 1990 killing at least 50,000 people and injuring 200,000 . The quake occurred when most people were inside asleep and hit a coastal floodplain where loosely deposited soil shifts easily and caused the fragile adobe homes in the area to collapse . The Iranian president appealed for international aid and the response was overwhelming , including assistance from the United States , the first such since the hostage crisis of 1979-80 . On the negative side , Iranian news media were slow to report on the disaster and the Iranian and U.S. government were blamed by their respective critics for the excessive casualties . 
The largest earthquake ( magnitude 7.7 ) ever to strike Iran occurred on June 20th . The Islamic Republic put the death toll at 36,000 and the number homeless at 400,000 . The opposition People 's Mojahedin blamed the government for shoddy housing that caused the deaths , which they said were underreported . The government , in turn , blamed the US for robbing it of oil resources and leaving too little for developing modern construction methods . Iran said it would accept aid from all countries , even the US , but not from Israel and South Africa . Relief supplies poured into Iran from all over the world , including the US . 
0.140740740740741	0	The earthquake that devastated Iran early Thursday took tens of thousands of lives because people were asleep in fragile homes built on flood plains, an earthquake expert said.
0.063973063973064	0	Most casualties from earthquakes are caused by something falling on top of you, said Russ Needham, a geophysist with the U.S. Geological Survey that monitors ground motion around the world.
0.136200716845878	0	The quake hit at 12:30 a.m. in Iran, when most of the people were in their homes, Needham said Thursday in a telephone interview from Golden, Colo.
0.124183006535948	0	At least 25,000 people died and thousands were injured in the quake, which demolished scores of villages and buried thousands of people in the rubble of their homes, Iranian officials said.
0	0	Needham said most structures in that area are built of a ceramic-type brick or adobe that collapses easily.
0	0	It's very similar to what we had in Armenia, he said of the Dec. 7, 1988, earthquake that killed about 25,000 people.
0.131944444444444	0	A Soviet parliamentary report later blamed the high number of fatalities on shoddily built buildings.
0	0	The Armenian quake was measured at 6.9 on the Richter scale, but Thursday's earthquake shook the earth with a magnitude of 7.7.
0.211111111111111	0	The shock wave traveled through the mountainous section of coastal Iran where most of the buildings are built on a flood plain of loosely deposited soil that shifts in an earthquake and allows structures to collapse, he said.
0.0811965811965812	0	The 7.7-magnitude quake was the largest ever recorded in that area, where two major plates of the earth's crust meet, Needhams said.
0	0	Iran is in a very active seismic region, he said, and that there have been many smaller quakes.
0	0	Twelve earthquakes greater than magnitude 7 have occurred in Iran during the last 30 years, Needhams said.
0.100529100529101	0	A quake of magnitude 7 is considered a major earthquake, capable of widespread, heavy damage in populated areas.
0	1	The earthquake that struck northern Iran brought reminders of another quake that devastated Soviet Armenia in 1988.
0	1	Like Thursday's earthquake in Iran, the Dec. 7, 1988, earthquake in Armenia killed about 25,000 people.
0.191919191919192	1	Most died in structures that collapsed when the quake hit.
0	1	It's very similar to what we had in Armenia, said Russ Needham, a geophysicist with the U.S. Geological Survey.
0	1	The Armenian quake was measured at 6.9 on the Richter scale, but Thursday's earthquake shook the earth with a magnitude of 7.7 according to the U.S. Geological Survey.
0.150793650793651	1	In the Iranian quake, the casualty count was pushed up by the fact that people were indoors and asleep at the time, just after midnight.
0	1	Many of the victims lived in fragile homes built of a ceramic-type brick or adobe that collapses easily.
0.100529100529101	1	In the Armenian quake, a Soviet parliamentary report later blamed the high number of fatalities on shoddily built buildings.
0	1	Most casualties from earthquakes are caused by something falling on top of you, said Needham in a telephone interview from Golden, Colo.
0.29320987654321	1	The quake struck an area of Iran where most of the buildings are built on a flood plain of loosely deposited soil that shifts in an earthquake and allows structures to collapse, Needham said.

0.0603174603174603	2	Iran is deliberately underreporting the number of casualties from Thursday's massive earthquake out of fear of a political backlash, leaders of a group seeking to overthrow the country's Islamic leadership say.
0.183574879227053	2	The regime is very much fearful of public outrage, said Shahin Gobadi, spokesman for the People's Mojahedin of Iran.
0	2	They're very much afraid of the political aftershocks.
0	2	As Gobadi spoke Friday, members of the organization denounced Iran's government at a noisy rally held in a park across the street from the White House.
0.117283950617284	2	Northern Iran was stuck Thursday by an earthquake measuring between 7.3 and 7.7 on the Richter Scale.
0.234567901234568	2	Iran has told the United Nations that the death toll is at least 36,000, but Gobadi said his organization has received estimates closer to 100,000.
0	2	Gobadi said the country cannot properly assist earthquake victims because its treasury has been spent in a war with neighboring Iraq and against internal opposition.
0	2	They have been very late in assisting the people, he said.
0	2	Sympathy for the earthquake victims was a secondary issue for the chanting, flag-waving rally participants, who also carried signs criticizing their native country.
0	2	Planning for the event began three weeks before the earthquake, but part of the Friday's activities focused on Iran's stricken residents.
0.191919191919192	2	Gobadi said shoddy housing in which the government forced people to live was the cause for the widespread loss of life.
0	2	This regime has brought them nothing but devastation and misery.
0	2	This regime has devoted all of its resources to a senseless war with Iraq and to oppression of the people at home, he said.
0	2	A U.N.-sponsored cease-fire was declared last year after eight years of the Iran-Iraq war.
0	2	Iran's Islamic republic was established in 1979 after Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi was deposed by Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini and militants seized the U.S. Embassy in Tehran, taking 66 Americans hostage.
0.351851851851852	2	The United States broke diplomatic relations with Iran in April 1980.
0	2	The shah died in exile in July 1980, U.S. hostages were freed six months later and Khomeini died last June.
0.105555555555556	2	Gobadi said his 25-year-old group had helped depose the shah but had no part in organizing the Islamic republic.
0	2	Even in this tragedy for which we grieve we cannot trust the regime in Iran, Rep. Mervyn Dymally, D-Calif., told an estimated 3,000 people attending the rally.
0.204301075268817	2	There were many, many victims before this tragedy and there are victims now whose needs need to be addressed by the people of the United States, he said.
0	2	Dymally, a member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, praised President Bush's offer of humanitarian aid to Iran but said Bush must make sure the assistance is channeled through non-government groups.
0	2	The State Department said Friday that Iran was willing to accept earthquake relief from the American Red Cross and other U.S. humanitarian organizations.
0.291187739463602	3	An anti-American newspaper in Iran said Sunday the United States is partly to blame for the death of tens of thousands of people in last week's earthquake.
0.0620915032679739	3	The criminal role of America in Iran's past became evident once again in the recent earthquake, the Jomhuri Islami said in an editorial reported by the official Islamic Republic News Agency.
0.117283950617284	3	Our people, even under the rubble, chant to America' and pray to God to cut off the hands of the United States even those hands stretched out to help, it said.
0.102981029810298	3	It argued that by plundering Iran's oil and other resources for 25 years, the United States had prevented the use of even a small part of the national wealth for urban development projects and advanced building construction systems.
0.136200716845878	3	Even after its expulsion from Iran, the U.S. government by imposing economic sanctions and launching several other plots, halted the renovation of the country, the editorial added.
0.191919191919192	3	The newspaper was implying that with these actions the United States had blocked the diversion of funds to earthquake safety measures.
0.204301075268817	3	If the United States has real humanitarian objectives and intended to help the Iranian nation, it should do only one thing, stop hatching plots, the newspaper said.
0.234567901234568	3	It called on Iranians to reject relief offers by the United States and other governments whose hands are stained with the blood of the Iranian people.
0.166666666666667	3	Iran, at odds with the United States since the 1979 seizure of hostages at the U.S. Embassy in Tehran, has said it would welcome relief from the American Red Cross and other U.S. humanitarian groups.
0	3	The two nations have no diplomatic ties.
0.180952380952381	4	Planes loaded with food, medicine and tents are converging on earthquake-stricken Iran from around the world, among them the first private American relief mission to the country in more than a decade.
0	4	Authorities now are faced with the difficult task of getting supplies into the affected areas.
0.287878787878788	4	More than 60 aftershocks jolted the quake zone in northwestern Iran on Sunday, triggering landslides along one key relief route.
0	4	Tehran radio said Sunday that 68 relief aircraft had landed at Tehran's Mehrabad airport during a 24-hour period.
0.281481481481482	4	Among them was a plane carrying medicine and other supplies from the United States.
0.211111111111111	4	Another plane carrying U.S. government aid was due today.
0.241269841269841	4	The shipment that arrived Sunday was the first of its kind to be accepted by Iran since the hostage crisis of 1979-80, when 52 Americans were held at the U.S. Embassy in Tehran.
0	4	Two countries that also have suffered devastating earthquakes in recent years, the Soviet Union and Mexico, were among those sending assistance to help victims of Thursday's quake.
0.0844444444444444	4	Leaders of Iran's Arab neighbors, including Iraq, which waged an eight-year war with Iran, issued statements of sympathy and support.
0	4	Pope John Paul II called on the international community to help earthquake victims, asking for a real and generous demonstration of solidarity with our brothers.
0	4	Let us pray that their suffering is alleviated.
0	4	The Vatican was among the many international donors.
0	4	Eleven planes from West Germany ferried in 145 tons of supplies plus a field hospital with two medical teams.
0	4	Nine flights arrived from Turkey.
0	4	The Spanish Red Cross sent medicines and food; India sent medicine.
0	4	The Austrian Red Cross shipped tents, blankets and medicine.
0.0681003584229391	4	Bernard Kouchner, the French secretary of state for humanitarian action, arrived in Iran on Sunday to coordinate French assistance and evaluate future needs, Radio France Inter said.
0.0844444444444444	4	The French government has sent a civil defense team of 195 people and 18 search dogs along with at least 24 tons of equipment.
0.0611916264090177	4	The Saudi-based 46-member Organization of the Islamic Conference, an umbrella organization for the world's estimated one billion Moslems, issued an urgent appeal to the international community and especially Islamic countries and organizations to hasten with emergency aid for the Iranians AmeriCares, a private U.S. relief organization based in New Canaan, Conn., flew in the 42 tons pounds of supplies that arrived Sunday.
0	4	To be on the ground here in Tehran is a very special feeeling for us, said Stephen M. Johnson, president of AmeriCares.
0.063973063973064	4	A spokeswoman for the U.S. Agency for International Development said a Red Cross charter flight carrying $225,000 worth of supplies donated by the U.S. government would arrive in Tehran this morning.
0.0917874396135266	4	Iran is believed to have influence with the Shiite Moslem extremists holding 16 Western hostages, including six Americans, in Lebanon.
0	4	The longest-held is Terry Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent of The Associated Press.
0	4	He was kidnapped March 16, 1985.
0	4	The Soviet Union sent in medical teams and supplies from Soviet republics bordering Iran.
0	4	More than 200 medical personnel arrived from the Soviet Union, which also sent medical supplies, trucks, trailers, ambulances, cranes, buses and water tankers.
0	4	The December 1988 earthquake in Soviet Armenia left at least 25,000 people dead.
0	4	Mexico, which lost at least 10,000 people in a 1985 earthquake, is sending food, medical supplies and blankets, officials said Sunday.
0	4	In Lebanon, the Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, said its members were donating 10 percent of their salaries to help the victims.
0	4	That would amount to about $500,000, according to Hezbollah sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
0	5	Americans who rushed to donate money to help victims of the Armenian earthquake 18 months ago are responding more slowly to last week's killer earthquake in Iran.
0	5	But relief agencies said they expect contributions to pick up.
0	5	There's a hierarchy of responsiveness, said Dick Colenso, associate executive director of World Concern, a private relief agency based in Seattle.
0	5	Something happens in Europe, there's a very large response, Asia, a pretty good respons down to the Middle East thee.
0	5	When you get dynamics change.
0	5	Colenso said, however, that contributions will surge upward as news spreads of the earthquake's destruction.
0.100529100529101	5	As you get the disaster translated into the lives of individuals instead of mass numbers, people begin to respond.
0	5	They relate to that, he said.
0.372549019607843	5	At least 50,000 people were reported killed and 200,000 injured in the earthquake that struck Thursday.
0.312757201646091	5	AmeriCares, a private agency based in New Canaan, Conn., brought the first shipment of supplies from the United States into Iran on Sunday.

0	5	POLITICAL DISSENT: Fang became politically prominent during the pro-democracy student demonstrations of 1986-87.
0	5	His speeches to students at the University of Science and Technology in Hefei in central China, where he was vice president, helped incite the protests, party hard-liners said.
0	5	Fang was expelled from the Communist Party in 1957, when he said Marxist theory on physics was obsolete.
0	5	In 1987, he was fired from his Hefei university posts.
0	5	In between, in 1966, he was a victim of the Cultural Revolution purges and was sent to a communal farm for re-education.

0.183574879227053	6	Iranian news media reacted with little emotion Thursday to a killer earthquake that left an estimated 25,000 people dead in northern Iran.
0	6	The country has endured several massive tragedies in recent years.
0	6	An estimated 1 million Iranians were killed or wounded in the eight-year war with Iraq that ended in 1988.
0.100529100529101	6	And the Islamic revolution that in 1979 toppled the late Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi cost hundreds of thousands of lives.
0	6	And devastating quakes are not new to the country.
0	6	About 25,000 people died in eastern Iran in a 1978 earthquake.
0	6	Roughly the same number died in a December, 1988, quake in nearby Soviet Armenia.
0.263888888888889	6	The Iranian media, monitored from Nicosia, was quick to report Thursday's earthquake.
0.183574879227053	6	Within half an hour, the Islamic Republic News Agency reported that the tremor had been felt in Tehran, the capital.
0	6	But subsequent reports, some a few minutes apart, said the damage must have been principally to crops, with brief mentions that many casualties were feared in Zanjan and Gilan provinces.
0.0681003584229391	6	The only detail reported for hours was that, when the quake hit, Tehran residents were either asleep or watching a World Cup soccer match between Brazil and Scotland.
0	6	The report said that many people fled into the streets.
0.124183006535948	6	In addition, the news agency's earliest reports dramatically underestimated the magnitude of the disaster.
0.201058201058201	6	While IRNA reported 10,000 dead late Thursday, the Iranian ambassador to the United Nations said 25,000 people had died.
0.0603174603174603	6	Official radio was off the air when the earthquake struck, and although it came back on the air to report important news during the Iran-Iraq War, there was no such move Thursday.
0	6	Iranian radio first reported the earthquake on the main newscast 6 1/2 hours later.
0.301587301587302	6	The radio, like the agency, also kept listeners informed about the areas hit and the number of casualties.
0	6	But again, the reporting lacked color and description for hours.
0.095959595959596	6	The television's first shots from the stricken north were screened 12 hours after the quake with no comment from reporters.
0	6	When the scenes were replayed during newscasts, the anchors appeared unshaken by chilling clips such as one showing a stuffed toy and a small shoe lying in a street carpeted with debris.
0	6	Iranian President Hashemi Rafsanjani declared a three-day period of mourning for quake victims.
0	6	But the television showed cartoons and an educational program for children and ended its programming with live transmission of a World Cup soccer match between Egypt and England.
0.211111111111111	7	Iran said today that it would welcome relief offered by its bitter enemy, the United States, to help victims of the earthquake that has killed as many as 35,000 people, the State Department said in Washington.
0	7	The aid would be accepted through the American Red Cross and other U.S. humanitarian organizations, deputy spokesman Richard Boucher said.
0	7	want to be helpful without regard for our political differences with Iran," he said.
0	7	There have been only rare instances of U.S.-Iranian cooperation since the two countries broke diplomatic relations a decade ago.
0.211111111111111	7	The United States holds Iran partly responsible for the continued detention of American hostages by pro-Iranian groups in Lebanon.
0.0703703703703704	7	Boucher said Iran told the U.S. government that private donor agencies should contact the Iranian Red Crescent, a humanitarian group that is the conduit for all outside assistance.
0.131944444444444	7	The U.S. government routinely channels humanitarian assistance through the Red Cross and other donor groups.
0.27536231884058	7	Boucher said the Iranian message to the United States presumably was delivered through a third party but added that he was uncertain.
0	7	Messages between the two countries normally are handled by the Swiss Embassy in Tehran.
0	7	Iranian authorities have told United Nations officials that about 35,000 people died in the earthquake.
1	7	Iran reportedly said it would accept aid from all countries including Iraq but excluded Israel and South Africa.
0	7	Rescuers in Iran today freed thousands of people from buildings flattened by the earthquake in northern Iran, which struck early Thursday and had a magnitude between 7.3 and 7.7.
0.263888888888889	7	The Islamic Republic News Agency said 6,000 people were pulled from rubble and airlifted from the stricken Gilan and Zanjan provinces to hospitals.
0.162393162393162	7	Iranian television showed scenes of devastation, including the remains of an entire row of hillside village houses that collapsed and slid down the hill.
0	7	Rescuers scooped up rubble and used police dogs to find victims.
0	7	They gently fed water to one man who was trapped in a mass of stones and earth, only his head protruding.
0	7	The Iranian Red Crescent asked for help in providing shelter for 400,000 people left homeless by the earthquake.
0	7	Offers of help came from across the globe.
0.127946127946128	7	The death toll was higher than a quake that killed 25,000 people in nearby Soviet Armenia in December, 1988, and a quake in Iran in 1978 that also killed 25,000.
0	7	In scenes shown on television, masked rescuers in white aprons pulled dust-covered bodies from under concrete slabs.
0	7	Corpses were laid on blocks of ice in open trucks.
0	7	The state-run television interviewed one middle-aged man from Roodbar, a mountainside village in Gilan province, who said he was sleeping when the temblor struck.

0.063973063973064	8	Setting aside years of animosity, the U.S. government joined with private humanitarian groups Friday to funnel medicine, tents, clothing, food and other relief materials to help earthquake-stricken Iran.
0.047979797979798	8	State Department officials said the government gave $300,000 worth of supplies to the American Red Cross for shipment to Iran including 1,000 hard hats, 1,000 pairs of leather gloves, 10,000 face masks, 2,940 wool blankets and about 500 tents.
0	8	The U.S. military, which often is used to ferry relief supplies to countries in need, stood ready to offer transport planes and logistics support for any U.S. aid requested by Iran.
0.0844444444444444	8	However, a Pentagon official said it is unlikely that the State Department and the White House would authorize a military airlift of supplies.
0	8	pretty clear that the Iranians don't want us, and there are so many alternatives, such as private charters, it really isn't necessary," the officials said.
0	8	a case like this, we would really be more of an irritant than a help."
0.0781893004115226	8	The quake, which rocked the northern region of Iran early Thursday, left nearly 29,000 dead, by official count, and about 400,000 homeless.
0.281481481481482	8	The death toll is expected to rise, however, as rescuers continue work.
0.156378600823045	8	Late Thursday, the Iranian Red Crescent appealed for help from the Red Cross and Red Crescent Society, a Geneva-based umbrella for international humanitarian organizations.
0.351851851851852	8	Iranian President Hashemi Rafsanjani, who toured the stricken region Friday, also appealed for international aid.
0.0469135802469136	8	Pat Davis, a spokesman for the American Red Cross in Washington, said Friday that although the Red Crescent is highly organized and well equipped, the large number of dead and suffering people has forced the Iranian agency to solicit international assistance.
0	8	The American Red Cross responded by mobilizing its local offices to solicit money, informing its toll-free telephone operators to request earmarked donations for the earthquake victims and sending $50,000 in cash to the Red Crescent Society to be used to help needy Iranians.
0.191919191919192	8	Some Jewish relief organizations found themselves in an uncomfortable position because of Iran's hostility toward the United States and Israel.
0.183574879227053	8	Confronted with reports that Iran would not welcome assistance from Israel, the groups were uncertain whether they should offer any assistance.
0.0603174603174603	8	Andy Griffel, executive director of American Jewish World Service, said directors of the assistance organization participated in a conference call Friday morning to debate whether to collect money for the Iranian victims.
0	8	After a spirited discussion, the group decided to help but to monitor the situation closely and to be prepared to change their decision.

0	9	Orange County's Iranian community launched an ambitious effort Sunday to collect half a million dollars in money, medicine, tents, blankets and sleeping bags for hundreds of thousands of injured and homeless people in earthquake-ravaged Iran.
0	9	Representatives of 11 Iranian professional and community groups manned tables near William R. Mason Regional Park, where contributors dropped off supplies, pledged other aid or made financial contributions.
0	9	Organizers said they hope to raise at least $500,000 in donations.
0	9	do this as long as it takes," said organizer Bijan Kian.
0	9	will be back here again next Sunday.
0	9	I have been in contact with a group that raised $150,000 by telephoning from home to home.
0	9	This is from their friends and relatives.
0	9	I'm sure we can double and triple that."
0.131944444444444	9	The 50 organizers Sunday wore black armbands expressing their grief for those killed, injured and left homeless in what they described as that country's worst earthquake of the century.
0	9	In Iran, rescue efforts were hampered Sunday as the strongest aftershock yet jarred the already severely damaged rice-growing region of Rasht, 120 miles northwest of Tehran.
0.063973063973064	9	The new shock, with a magnitude of 5.7, toppled the few still-standing structures and caused mudslides that temporarily closed the road linking Rasht with other destruction zones in Zanjan province.

0	9	is made that much more difficult because it is the rainy season."
0	9	Shokooh said the effort to help the earthquake victims was put together hastily Friday afternoon.
0	9	The group set up the collection point in front of William R. Mason Regional Park on property belonging to the City of Irvine.
0	9	Irvine Police Sgt. Tom Hume, who is in charge of policing special events held in the city, said the group failed to obtain a permit from the city.
0	9	But police accommodated the group, blocking off a bike lane on University Avenue so cars could pull in and unload supplies for the earthquake victims.
0	9	The supplies were put into a large truck parked along the road.
0	9	Hume said that two officers assigned to the event reported the crowd as small.
0	9	Organizer Genia Panahi, 40, of Newport Beach, said the 150 Iranian doctors practicing in Orange County responded to calls for medicine, surgical gloves, disposable needles and blood bags.

0.25	5	Chief Petty Officer Lance Vickery recalls waves tumbling into the stern of the bobbing ferry headed back to the USS Saratoga and joking, Whoa, looks like we're flooding.
0	5	Only minutes later, his words came true, turning a simple ride back from Christmas shore leave into a harrowing fight to survive.
0.166666666666667	5	The Israeli ferry Tuvia capsized shortly after midnight on Saturday, throwing more than 100 men into the cold waters of Haifa Bay.
0.363636363636364	5	At least 19 sailors drowned, and scores were injured.
0.333333333333333	5	The sailors were part of the multinational force arrayed against Iraq.
0	5	Vickery, 33, was among four American sailors interviewed at Haifa's Rambam Hospital.
0	5	He is from Jacksonville, Fla., is not far from Mayport, the Saragota's home port.
0.133333333333333	5	Three of the sailors said the boat had been taking on water over the stern in heavy seas, then capsized when it was hit by a big wave.
0	5	Vickery said the fatal wave came about a minute after he had cracked his joke.
0	5	All of a sudden, I saw water just come flying in, he said.
0	5	And it was maybe two seconds, and the boat rolled right over.
0.166666666666667	5	The 13-year veteran sailor found himself trapped in the ferry's cabin, frantically struggling to find a window as the ship sank.
0	5	I started breathing in water and almost died, Vickery said.
0	5	If I had been under the water maybe another 30 seconds, I wouldn't be lying here right now.
0	5	I'd be in one of those body bags out there.
0	5	When he made his way to the surface he found guys floating everywhere, screaming and yelling like chaos.
0	5	Despite his own predicament, he grabbed a struggling fellow sailor by the collar and dragged him toward a floating, plastic foam life ring.
0	5	One rescue boat, already overloaded, passed by and threw life preservers.
0	5	In what seemed like an hour, another boat came, also full.
0	5	So they just dragged us through the water back to the Saratoga, and I was a real happy person to see those guys snatching me up, he said.
0	5	As Vickery was being treated for bleeding lungs caused by water inhalation, his hospital roommate, Seaman Michael Benjamin, 19, of San Antonio, Texas, was recovering from a neck injury suffered when a rescue boat hit him while he was in the water.
0	5	Both were wearing blue hospital pajamas and, when they walked to the visiting room's balcony could see the Saratoga anchored outside the Haifa harbor.
0	5	Benjamin, who has been in the navy for just a year, said the ferry had been jostled in heavy seas.
0	5	As we were going on the waves, I just noticed one that was bigger than normal and then another one that was bigger than normal, he said.
0	5	The next thing I know, all I saw coming in was water, he said.
0	5	Benjamin said he dove from the ferry, then had to swim frantically to get away from the suction of the sinking boat.
0	5	Clinging to a foam plastic float, he was passed by one rescue boat and hit by a second.
0	5	I looked around and I see this big hull coming at me and we were all yelling, but I guess the ship didn't see us, he said.
0	5	I was trying to get out of the way, but I got hit by the ship.
0	5	Dazed, Benjamin stripped off his jacket, shirt and shoes and kept treading water until he found a piece of driftwood to cling to.
0	5	I was scared, he admitted.
0	5	I was having a hard time staying up in the water.
0	5	A rescue ship picked him up, he estimated, about a half hour to 45 minutes later.
0	5	Two other men interviewed at Rambam Hospital identified themselves as Technician John Richards, 31, of Twin Lake, Mich., and Airman Lamont Jones, 20, of Claremont, Va.
0	5	Both were breathing with difficulty despite gas masks.
0	5	Richards recalled seeing a large wave and feeling the ship heeling to one side.
0	5	All I can remember thinking is, my God, it's sinking,' and then I was scrambling for my life, he said faintly.
0.833333333333333	6	A boat carrying hundreds of Somali refugees struck a reef off Kenya and sank, killing more than 130 people, newspapers reported.
0.166666666666667	6	The accident involving a vessel ferrying about 600 people occurred Friday near Malindi, a tourist resort about 400 miles southeast of Nairobi.
1	6	First accounts of the accident were reported Sunday in Kenyan newspapers.
0.173913043478261	6	Two English-language dailies said the accident occurred one mile off the coast, but a third said it was six miles away.
0	6	Police, navy divers, tourists and local residents had recovered about 130 bodies by Saturday afternoon, but 50 victims were believed still trapped in the sunken vessel, according to the newspapers.
0	6	Confirmation from local authorities of the accounts was not immediately available.
0	6	The boat with the refugees had set sail from the Somali town of Kismayo, 250 miles north of Malindi, on Feb. 26.
0	6	It was one of a stream of vessels that brought thousands of Somalis seeking refuge to Kenya since rebels overthrew Somalian President Mohamed Siad Barre in late January.
0	6	The victory followed a month of heavy fighting in Mogadishu, capital of the East African nation.
0	6	The fighting appears largely to have stopped since the rebel United Somali Congress established an interim government, but refugees continue to arrive in Kenya.
0	6	Abdi Mohammed Ali, a survivor, was quoted as telling the Standard newspaper that most of those who drowned were on the ship's lower deck.
0.137931034482759	6	First word of the accident came when two survivors staggered into the Jambo Club tourist hotel, manager Barney Ngare was quoted as saying by the Sunday Nation.
0	6	The hotel sent a small boat to help save those still on the sinking vessel, but rescue workers had to cut the lifeline when too many people grabbed hold, according to Ngare.
0	6	Another boat sent by the hotel ferried 15 people at a time to shore, said the Nation.

0	7	Investigators, meanwhile, were looking into complaints from some of the 178 survivors that the crew of the Salem Express abandoned ship without helping them into lifeboats or flotation gear.
0	7	They also want to know why the ferry strayed outside standard navigational channels.
0	7	The 1,105-ton ship went down Saturday night about six miles off the Egyptian coast after ramming into a coral reef in stormy 10-foot seas.
0.181818181818182	7	are looking for both survivors and bodies," said Brig. Abdel-Karim el-Gazzar, Egypt's deputy chief of port security.
0	7	haven't lost all hope that there may be some survivors, although the odds are against it."
0	7	Prime Minister Atef Sidki, who traveled to Safaga, said many passengers may have been on lifeboats driven far from the wreck scene by strong winds.
0	7	Ahmed Gamal Sobhi, Safaga's city council chairman, said only four bodies were recovered by Egyptian vessels and helicopters and the time nightfall and bad weather stopped Sunday's search.

0	7	Outside the harbor, scores of relatives of passengers squatted on a sidewalk or huddled in taxis, awaiting word about their kin.
0.125	7	Hassan Al-Aghouri, Egypt's chief of port security, said the Egyptian-registered ferry inexplicably left standard navigational channels and investigators were seeking to question surviving crew about the course change.
0	7	The investigation also will try to determine whether the ferry was carrying enough lifeboats.
0	7	Al-Ahram, a leading Cairo newspaper, said in an unattributed report today that the vessel left the charted navigation channel to take a shortcut.
0	7	It said naval authorities warned the skipper back on course to avoid the area's abundant coral reefs.

0	8	Moharram said he helped 17 passengers put on life jackets.
0.210526315789474	8	He said the ferry sank quickly Saturday night after being tossed into a coral reef by stormy seas.

0	8	We waited until a ship rescued us at around noon."
0	8	Prime Minister Atef Sidki, who traveled to Safaga, said many passengers may have been on lifeboats driven far from the wreckage by strong winds.
0	8	However, many bodies were expected to be found in the hull of the ferry.

0.297297297297297	2	TOKYO Emperor Hirohito will be remembered for one overwhelming decision during his 62-year reign: Japan must bow to defeat for the first time in its history and end the Pacific conflict in World War II.
0.0873015873015873	2	Shortly after that decision, and for most of his reign, Hirohito became a figurehead, isolated from his subjects by tradition and steeped in his great love, the study of marine biology.
0.392857142857143	2	He was the last survivor among the national leaders of the World War II era.
0	2	But in his first 20 years, the Son of Heaven was worshiped as a divinity descended from the Sun Goddess Amaterasu.
0.0962099125364431	2	The solitude of animal and plant life under the seas which so intrigued Hirohito was in keeping with the character of the man who became the 124th occupant of the Chrysanthemum Throne at the age of 25 on Christmas Day 1926, designating his reign Showa enlightened peace.
0.241758241758242	2	The emperor was generally portrayed as having played no significant role in planning or carrying out Japan's military adventures in the 1930s and 1940s.
0	2	But it was his first effective decision as emperor, and his most courageous, that ended the Pacific conflict.
0.0582010582010582	2	On Aug. 10, 1945, four days after history's first atomic bomb devastated Hiroshima and one day after a U.S. bomber dropped the second atomic bomb on Nagasaki, the generals and admirals of Imperial Japan's wartime government argued for hours in the sweltering bombproof shelter beneath the Tokyo palace.
0	2	Should Japan agree to the Allies' surrender demand, or fight on until annihilation?
0.147321428571429	2	Speaking in what some of those present described as a slow and obviously nervous monotone, Hirohito, the spiritual and titular leader, offered his opinion for the first time.
0	2	He spoke of his sorrow over the soldiers and sailors killed in the long war, and of families who lost everything in air raids.
0	2	I cannot bear to see my innocent people suffer any longer, he said.
0	2	Ending the war is the only way to restore world peace and to relieve the nation from the terrible distress with which it is burdened.
0.0341614906832298	2	Then, evoking a memory of his grandfather, the Emperor Meiji, whose reign saw the end of 250 years of feudal Japanese isolation from the outside world, Hirohito told the officers: The time has come when we must bear the unbearable.
0.120879120879121	2	In the days that followed, Hirohito continued his break with tradition.
0	2	In a national radio broadcast Aug. 15 the first time ordinary Japanese ever actually heard his voice he personally announced the decision to surrender.
0	2	He told the ravaged nation that the war situation has developed not necessarily to our advantage.
0.0448979591836735	2	Three weeks later, Hirohito donned a silk cutaway coat, striped trousers and a top hat to meet the Allied commander, Gen. Douglas A. MacArthur, at the U.S. Embassy in Tokyo.
0	2	It was the first time Hirohito had ever gone to see anyone, and the first of several calls on the general who had led the Pacific war against Japan and became its postwar governor.
0.0827067669172932	2	On New Year's Day 1946, at MacArthur's insistence, the emperor publicly renounced his divinity.
0	2	It was a choice that enabled Hirohito to remain as the symbolic head of his nation and assured that he would not face charges as a war criminal, as some abroad had demanded.
0	2	It also was an act that seemed to relieve no one as much as this gentle, shy and retiring man who never seemed very comfortable as a living god.
0.0873015873015873	2	The emperor's status in the eyes of many Japanese changed to that of a kind uncle.
0	2	He became a widely respected authority on marine biology.
0	2	He possessed rare collections of marine life, discovered several species himself and wrote or co-authored at least 12 books on hydrozoa, or sea animals, his specialty.
0	2	In recent years, his life had become the subject of a popular comic book series.
0.130952380952381	2	Still, Hirohito and the imperial system remained important to Japan.
0	2	A nationwide survey by the daily newspaper Mainichi Shimbun in March 1987 indicated more than 80 percent of 2,184 people polled supported the imperial system, while only 11 percent said it should be abolished.
0.157142857142857	2	Five percent said the emperor should have more power.
0.104761904761905	2	From 1946 to 1954, Hirohito toured Japan to encourage the people to rebuild.
0	2	The Imperial Household Agency, which ran his affairs, said Hirohito considered the postwar period one of the most fulfilling times of his life, in which the nation made a phenomenal recovery from a war that cost 3.1 million Japanese lives.
0.0827067669172932	2	Despite the humanization of the Imperial family, Hirohito remained under strict control of the Imperial Household Agency.
0	2	Protocol was maintained at nearly all times and he was prohibited from speaking on any controversial subject.
0.174603174603175	2	Hirohito was born on April 29, 1901.
0.046218487394958	2	In accordance with age-old imperial custom, he was taken from his parents as an infant to be reared in isolation by household functionaries and trained for one role, that of emperor.
0	2	His education came as Japan surged into the modern world.
0.0392857142857143	2	The feudal samurai ethic was still strong; when his grandfather died, Gen. Maresuke Nogi, the mentor for the 11-year-old prince, calmly committed ritual suicide to follow the emperor, his master, to the grave.
0	2	Hirohito studied government and law with private tutors.
0	2	When he was 20, his father, Emperor Taisho, sent him abroad the first time any member of the immediate imperial family was allowed outside Japan.
0	2	Hirohito visited England, Scotland, France, Belgium, the Netherlands and Italy, receiving various decorations.
0	2	He was also received by Pope Benedict XV.
0	2	The young man handled money for the first time, paying his own fare on the Paris subway.
0	2	He developed a passion for bacon and eggs and it became a lifelong breakfast habit.
0	2	A palace chamberlain said in a 1980 interview that Hirohito shunned Japanese food unless it is forced on him by an unwitting host.
0	2	Hirohito also acquired a preference for Western clothes.
0.0561224489795918	2	He was never seen in public wearing traditional Japanese garb, and a palace official confided that the Emperor of Japan did not even own a kimono.
0	2	Hirohito became prince regent on Nov. 25, 1921, after his father became a mental and physical invalid, became emperor five years later and was formally enthroned in 1928.
0.289473684210526	3	World leaders from President Reagan to Malaysia's king mourned today's death of Emperor Hirohito, who surrendered a broken nation to the Allies in World War II but presided over its rise to economic pre-eminence.

0.112244897959184	3	A leading newspaper in Seoul, The Joong-Ang Daily News, wrote that Hirohito's death reminds all the Korean people of a disgraced period and humiliation.
0.157142857142857	3	Hirohito is the symbolic figure who must assume most and final responsibility for preposterous crimes to the Korean people.
0.0873015873015873	3	Korea was divided into the communist north and the capitalist south in 1945, when U.S. and Soviet troops ended Japan's rule that began in 1910 with Japan's forced annexation of the peninsula.
0.213075060532688	3	There was no official comment from the nationalist Chinese government because of the lack of diplomatic relations between Taiwan and Japan, but the mass circulation Chinese daily United Evening News said: Asian people who suffered from the slavery and invasion of Japan's militarists during World War II may bury their animosity with Hirohito's death.
0.174603174603175	3	Chinese suffered the most from the Japanese invasion.
0.0436507936507936	3	It was an irony that while Hirohito apologized to the United States and Europe for the war, he did not direct a single word to China to show his sorrow.Now, Hirohito has died.

0	3	Now, as Japan enters a period of mourning and prepares for a new age, our thoughts are with you.
0	3	But Bruce Ruxton, an official of the Returned Services League, which representing almost 300,000 Australian war veterans, said there would not be too many tears shed around the world.

0	3	Marine biologists paid homage to another facet of the monarch's life his 12 books published on hydrozoa, or sea animals.

0	5	His biography of China's last monarch was used for the award-winning film The Last Emperor.
0.0805860805860806	5	It has been reported previously that American prosecutors wanted to keep Hirohito out of the war crimes trial and asked Tojo to suggest the emperor had consented reluctantly to the war on the advice of the High Command.
0.0383275261324042	5	Gen. Douglas MacArthur, commander of the U.S. forces occupying Japan, wrote in his book Reminiscences that he fended off pressure from Britain and the Soviet Union to indict Hirohito, arguing that would touch off a guerrilla war.
0	5	Behr told The Associated Press in a telephone interview Wednesday that the documentary will be shown in the United States by PBS on March 13.
0	5	The BBC has also sold it to Australia, Austria, Canada, Hong Kong, Israel, Korea, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain and Sweden.
0.873015873015873	5	Hirohito died Saturday at the age of 87.
0.157142857142857	5	The documentary says the decision not to prosecute Hirohito came from President Harry S. Truman and that Tojo's evidence was altered so the emperor would not be incriminated.
0.130952380952381	6	To the rest of the world, he was known as Emperor Hirohito, but in Japan his given name was seldom used.
0.104761904761905	6	In Japanese he was simply called Tenno Heika, meaning His Majesty The Emperor.
0.0582010582010582	6	The foreign habit of using his name rankled some Japanese, who found it impolite, and unnecessary since to them there is only one emperor.
0.0628571428571429	6	Some Japanese complained that after his death it even became inaccurate to call him Hirohito because he has been given the posthumous name Showa.
0.174603174603175	6	In Japanese histories, he will be recorded as Emperor Showa, the name he chose for his reign soon after he became emperor in 1926.
0.282051282051282	6	It means Enlightened Peace, and has been succeeded by Heisei, or Achieving Peace, the name the government chose for the reign of Hirohito's son Akihito a few hours after the emperor died Jan. 7.
0	6	But for the convenience of the rest of the world, which is not so able to keep track of the person behind the changed name, even official agencies have used the name Hirohito in English-language publications.
0.0561224489795918	6	The obituary issued in English by the Foreign Press Center, which is supported by the Foreign Ministry, was headed His late Majesty The Emperor Hirohito.
0.0698412698412698	6	English-language newspapers published in Japan quickly began using the name Showa for Hirohito after his death, but it did not become truly official until Jan. 31, when Emperor Akihito conducted a ceremony in which Showa became the late emperor's posthumous name.
0	6	A stone tablet placed in his tomb is engraved only with the posthumous name and the dates of his death and burial.
0.125714285714286	6	The custom of renaming emperors after the completion of their reigns began after the death in 1912 of Emperor Meiji, Hirohito's grandfather.
0.196428571428571	6	In Japan, years are numbered according to the emperor's tenure on the throne.
0.0628571428571429	6	Thus 1926 became Showa 1 as Crown Prince Hirohito ascended to the throne on Dec. 25 when his father, Emperor Taisho, died.
0.392857142857143	6	The year 1927 was Showa 2, and 1989 was Showa 64 until Hirohito's death on Jan. 7.
0	6	Now this year is Heisei 1.
0.0523809523809524	6	The Japanese custom of changing imperial names is not unique among world royalty, where an individual may have a variety of names and titles in a royal career.
0	6	In Britain, Prince Andrew became the Duke of York upon his marriage in 1986.
0.0785714285714286	7	Emperor Hirohito left $13.06 million in taxable property, a tax office near the Imperial Palace announced Monday.
0.0561224489795918	7	It was the first time that tax authorities have disclosed the amount of an emperor's taxable estate, an official in the Kojimachi Tax Office said.
0.20952380952381	7	Until the end of World War II, emperors were regarded as living gods.
1	7	Hirohito died of cancer on Jan. 7 at age 87.
0.314285714285714	7	He was succeeded by Akihito, his eldest son.
0.157142857142857	7	Hirohito's wife, Nagako, became empress dowager.
0	7	Akihito has paid $2.99 million in inheritance taxes on his half of his father's estate, which he divided evenly with his mother.
0.0748299319727891	7	The empress dowager, as Hirohito's spouse, was exempt from paying inheritance taxes, Kyodo News Service reported.
0.261904761904762	7	The Japanese constitution, drafted by U.S. occupation forces shortly after the end of World War II in 1945, stipulates the emperor is the symbol of the state and the unity of the people.
0.157142857142857	7	Hirohito's estate included stocks and other personal belongings.
0	7	Three sacred treasures a mirror, sword and jewels which were transferred from emperor to emperor, were tax-exempt, as were about 3,180 items of art owned by Hirohito that were donated to the state, the tax office official said.
0.16988416988417	8	The death of Emperor Hirohito finished the list of political and military leaders of the World War II era, one of the darkest and bloodiest eras of history on either the European or Asian continents.
0.0785714285714286	8	The political and military role that Emperor Hirohito played before and during the war was never clear to us.
0	8	He may not have had that kind of influence now, but before the war he was regarded as god and was worshiped in Japan with religious vigor.
0.108374384236453	8	At the surrender of the Imperial Japanese government, Hirohito was spared punishment because was his ambitious military generals who made the decision to invade the neighbors."
0.0327380952380952	8	I found it is very hard to believe that a man in his middle age, in his position, in his culture and in his country at that time had nothing much to do with all the military aggravations that his armies imposed on neighboring countries.
0.0785714285714286	8	Of course, some Japanese military leaders were executed after the war for criminal acts they were responsible for.
0	8	I often wonder if Hirohito ever felt grateful to those generals who were sacrificed, in part, so that he could live for another 43 years.
0.107142857142857	8	I only wish that the soul of Emperor Hirohito be ready to face the ultimate justice when he meets with the waiting souls of millions of innocent men, women and children who were tortured and murdered in his name during the war.

0.308641975308642	2	The 26-year-old drifter with a long criminal record who launched a mute, murderous assault on a California elementary school Tuesday was described by his aunt as a loner and childhood alcoholic, police said.
0.389863547758285	2	Patrick E. Purdy purchased an AK-47 rifle in this Portland suburb several months ago, then returned to his hometown of Stockton, Calif., where he used the gun to kill five children and wound 29 others, along with a teacher, at Cleveland Elementary School before taking his own life, authorities said.
0.0617283950617284	2	Purdy, who went by the alias of Patrick West, had lived with an aunt and uncle in Sandy from the first of July until late October, said Sandy Police Chief Fred Punzel.
0	2	He later moved to Lodi, Calif., where he listed his mailing address under the name of his grandmother, Julia Chumbley, although he did not live with her, authorities said.
0	2	It's just horrible.
0	2	I don't understand why and I probably won't ever know why, said Ms. Chumbley, a 63-year-old retired cannery worker.
0	2	It troubles me to think that such a terrible thing can happen.
0	2	It's like a nightmare.
0	2	This sort of thing happens to others, not you.
0	2	Your own grandson.
0	2	Stockton is about 15 miles southwest of Lodi.
0.0925925925925926	2	Punzel said Purdy's aunt, Julie Michael, told me he was a loner and as a child he was an alcoholic.
0	2	Mrs. Michael said through a closed front door at her residence that she was too upset to talk to reporters.
0	2	Her next-door neighbor, Pat Thomas, 45, said she met West when he lived with his relatives last summer.
0	2	He seemed like a real nice young man, she said.
0.317460317460317	2	He was here looking for work.
0.123456790123457	2	However, Purdy had an extensive criminal history, mostly in the Los Angeles area, said Lucian Neely, deputy police chief in Stockton, an agricultural city 60 miles east of San Francisco.
0.138888888888889	2	Purdy had no criminal record in Sandy, Clackamas County or Portland, authorities said.
0	2	Neely said Purdy originally was from Stockton and that he had purchased the gun at the Sandy Trading Post Aug. 3.
0	2	Punzel said Mrs. Michael told him Purdy left Oregon for a job as a boilermaker in Texas.
0	2	That job fell through and he went to Memphis, Tenn.
0	2	The aunt and uncle last heard from Purdy at Thanksgiving, when he was in Connecticut, Punzel said.
0	2	His mother lives in Sacramento, Calif., and his father was killed in 1980 or 1981 when he was struck by a car as a pedestrian, Punzel said.

0.202020202020202	3	Twenty-nine other pupils were wounded, along with a teacher.
0	3	There was shooting all over.
0	3	I was scared, said sixth-grader Binh Hoang, who was born in Vietnam in 1975 in the final days of war and had never before heard gunfire.
0	3	Everybody was crying in my class.
0.596205962059621	3	Police said a drifter identified as Patrick Edward Purdy, 26, armed with two handguns and an AK-47 assault rifle, entered the school grounds around noontime Tuesday and fired about 60 rounds before he shot himself to death.
0.0925925925925926	3	Afterward, a large handgun and the assault rifle lay on the ground near a pool of blood and the gunman's body.
0	3	The word victory was written on the pistol handle.
0.123456790123457	3	Binh said she was sitting in math class when the shooting began outside the wood-and-stucco school building.
0	3	Her teacher told students to get under their desks.
0	3	The gunfire startled Michael Cuevas, whose first thought was that the University of the Pacific fraternities near his house were firing their miniature cannon again.
0	3	But the shots repeated too rapidly for a cannon, and the scream of sirens that followed told him this time was no prank.
0.126984126984127	3	I never thought a tragedy of this magnitude could happen in Stockton, said Cuevas, a 29-year-old marine clerk at the Port of Stockton who lives down the street from the elementary school.
0	3	It's always in some other town, some other place.
0	3	It's a shock to my senses.
0	3	I don't think it's even hit me as hard as it's going to.
0	3	You don't know whether to be excited, or confused or what.
0	3	Police cars and news reporters crowded the street, which typically is busy only when parents pick up and drop off their children.
0	3	said Jeff Russell, 37, who was born and reared in the neighborhood.
0	3	This has always been a sleepy little town.
0	3	put us back on the map.
0.0584795321637427	3	Lutheran and Baptist churches border the school in a neighborhood of ranch-style homes, postage-stamp lawns and streets lined with sycamore and oak trees in this agricultural city of 150,000 people 60 miles southeast of San Francisco.
0	3	The 40-year-old neighborhood near the University of the Pacific is still home to many retired couples who raised their familes there.
0.476190476190476	3	But the city has been changing with the influx of Southeast Asian refugees.
0.177777777777778	3	When school officials called clergy to console grieving families, Buddhist priests in sandals and saffron robes arrived along with their white-collared Christian counterparts.
0.444444444444444	3	About 60 percent of Cleveland Elementary's students are of Southeast Asian descent, said John Klose, spokesman for the Stockton School District.
0.404040404040404	3	The five children who were killed were Vietnamese and Cambodian.
0	3	This is one of our best neighborhood schools, Klose said.
0	3	Of all of our schools that I would think of something like this happening, this would be the last one I would think of.
0.202020202020202	3	Across the street, Sarah Abbott stood astride her bicycle and gazed at the school where she graduated many years ago.
0.0694444444444444	3	The professional nanny said she was at the house of her 97-year-old grandfather about a block from the school when the gunman set his car on fire before starting to shoot.
0	3	When the car exploded, my grandpa's house just shook, Abbott said.
0	3	It scared me.
0	3	It was just too close.
0.261437908496732	4	A South Carolina school where a gunman killed two 8-year-old girls Sept. 26 will send cards and offer words of encouragement to a California school that lost five pupils in a shooting rampage.
0.130718954248366	4	We will tell them they can survive this, said Kat Finkbeiner, a physical education teacher whose jaw was shattered in the shooting spree last year at Greenwood's Oakland Elementary School.
0	4	I would tell them, on your community, share the sorrow.'
0	4	We've lived through this.
0	4	I know we can help.
0.28673835125448	4	On Sept. 26, a man with a history of mental problems opened fire with a handgun at Oakland Elementary School, killing two youngsters and wounding nine other people.
0	4	Ms. Finkbeiner helped subdue the gunman, Jamie Wilson, 19.
1	4	On Tuesday, a 26-year-old drifter with a long crimnal record opened fire with an assault rifle at Cleveland Elementary School in Stockton, Calif., killing five children and wounding 30 other people before taking his own life.
0	4	It's unhappy, but they can live through it; they can be happy another day, Ms. Finkbeiner said.
0.056980056980057	4	Children at the Greenwood school will be asked to send cards to the California school, while the principal, Eleanor Rice, and Ms. Finkbeiner said they will contact officials at the Stockton school to offer encouragement.
0	4	Our wounds have not closed.
0	4	We are still hurting.
0	4	It makes us more compassionate for these people, the principal said.
0	4	Eveline Higginbotham, the third-grade teacher in whose classroom the two little girls died, said the California tragedy just brings it all back again.
0	4	I'm just in shock, she said.
0.193236714975845	5	Here is a profile of the gunman who took the lives of five children at a Stockton, Calif., school Tuesday.

0.0666666666666667	9	And the companies show few signs of cutting back on their activities despite the new tax law's tighter restrictions on what can be claimed as a business-entertainment expense.
0.166666666666667	9	Still, the new rules do change things for a variety of Super Bowl entertaining from an executive sitting in a $1,500 seat on the 50-yard line to a businessman holding a Super Bowl party in his living room and hoping to write off the costs.
0.529411764705882	9	One big change under the new law limits business-entertainment deductions for tickets to sporting events like the Super Bowl: Only 80% of the face value of such tickets can be deducted.
0.242424242424242	9	If a company purchases a a 50-yard-line seat for $1,500 the going rate it can deduct only 80% of the ticket's $75 face value, or $60.
0.1	9	Even to get the 80% deduction, there still must be a and bona fide business discussion" before, during or after the game, says Julian Block, a tax specialist at Prentice-Hall Information Services Inc.
0	9	To take a client to a game as merely a good-will gesture is no longer enough, Mr. Block says.
0.0689655172413793	9	And if a company wants to simply give clients tickets to the game, the business gift carries a total deduction of only $25 for each recipient.

0.08	9	Air fare and lodging are still 100% deductible, as long as there is a planned business meeting in addition to the game.
0.153846153846154	9	Meals are now 80% deductible as long as business is discussed.
0.08	9	Under the old law, meals were fully deductible and all a company had to do was show a business relationship with the guest.
0.0833333333333333	9	Companies can get a 100% deduction for a pre-Super Bowl banquet, since the new tax law has a meeting exception."
0	9	Such meetings must have at least 40 persons, half of whom are away from home, and there must be a speaker.
0.1	9	Executives who bring clients over to the house to watch the Super Bowl on television also face new restrictions on deductions for food and liquor, says William J. Lipton, tax partner of the accounting firm Ernst Whinney.
0.142857142857143	9	If a host wants to deduct 80% of the bill, he or she must talk business with all of the guests, Mr. Lipton says.
0	9	One safety measure: Make a business-oriented speech, Mr. Block suggests.
0	9	He also advises party hosts to keep a guest list and note their business connection.
0.0754716981132075	9	That will be a big job for Barron Hilton, chairman of Hilton Hotels Corp., who along with Alex Spanos, owner of the San Diego Chargers, is holding a pre-Super Bowl brunch Sunday at the Beverly Hilton Hotel for 1,800 guests including business leaders, entertainment personalities and customers.
0	9	Allen Hermansen, a Hilton senior vice president, says the bash is tax deductible because sales people will be there and business will be discussed."
0	9	He admits, however, not going to twist any arms.
0	9	We're there to say thank-you to those who've given us business."
0	9	An IRS spokesman says more agents will be assigned to corporate audits of business-entertainment expenses this year.

The relatively low casualties were a result of an accurate prediction of the point of windfall by hurricane forecasters , effective evacuation measures and good response from residents . Total insured losses from Hugo were estimated near $ 5 billion , by far the costliest storm to ever hit the area , but insurers expressed confidence in being able to satisfy all claims . 
The two largest property insurance companies in the Carolinas , State Farm and Nationwide , estimate Hurricane Hugo losses at $ 600 million , making it the costliest hurricane ever . Hugo , a Category 4 storm dubbed a " killer hurricane " by Charleston 's mayor , struck the city Thursday night . Though there was significant damage , only two were killed in Charleston , 17 total in South Carolina .

0	0	It strengthened more than we thought it would, Sheets said, adding that Hugo would cause severe flooding as it moved up the Appalachians.
0.1328125	0	The timing of the landfall was critical because of the storm's tidal surge, a dome of water 10 to 15 feet high that would feed a normal 5-foot high tide that peaks after 2 a.m. On top of that will be waves, Sheets said earlier, and in many places on barrier islands the buildings will be swept clean off.
0.137096774193548	1	This historic city has survived the ravages of earthquake, battle and storm in its storied 300-year-history, but it faced perhaps its greatest test of all in Hurricane Hugo.
1	1	The storm, packing winds of up to 135 mph, raged into Charleston Thursday night.
0.3984375	1	This is a dangerous, killer hurricane, the likes of which few people who have lived all their lives in Charleston have experienced, warned Mayor Joseph P. Riley Jr.
0.193181818181818	1	Hugo was the first major hurricane to strike Charleston since Hurricane Gracie came ashore 70 miles to the south in 1959.
0	1	The seaside community has suffered through many disasters, both natural and man-made.
0.257575757575758	1	The worst in recent decades was in 1938 when a tornado tore through the city, killing 32 people, injuring hundreds and causing an estimated $2 million in property damage.
0.184782608695652	1	Charleston, a city of pastel-colored antebellum structures lining quaint streets and alleyways, is where the Civil War began in 1861.
0.293103448275862	1	The city has survived the shot and shell of two wars and any number of smaller hurricanes, politely referred to by Charlestonians of refinement as September gales.
0.118055555555556	1	But the worst natural disaster to beset the city occurred on the hot night of Aug. 31, 1886, when the ground rumbled in what some folks thought was a prelude to Judgement Day.
0.265625	1	The great Charleston earthquake was felt as far away as Chicago and New York City.
0.125	1	Measuring 7.7 on the Richter scale of ground motion, the earthquake claimed an estimated 110 lives, destroyed 102 buildings and tossed most of the city's 14,000 chimneys into the streets.
0.17	1	In recent years, the city has attracted millions of visitors annually who tour its historic buildings and visit its nearby fine sand beaches.

0.314814814814815	2	While Hurricane Hugo's 135 mph wind roared outside, Mayor Joseph P. Riley Jr. watched the fury it vented on his beloved, 300-year-old city.
0.459459459459459	2	Riley, city officials and a few reporters stayed in Charleston's historic City Hall through Thursday night as the area's worst hurricane in three decades pounded the coastal city where the Civil War began.
0	2	Late in the day, there was hope Hugo might spare Charleston.
0.283333333333333	2	But the storm gathered strength and speed as it spun straight toward this city, which had survived a number of near misses from great storms in recent years.
0.163461538461538	2	From the moment it became apparent Hugo might strike the Southeast coast, many Charlestonians conceded that, this time, their number was up.
0	2	As Hugo's wind howled outside the plywood boards protecting the windows, reporters wandered in and out of Riley's office.
0	2	On his desk several candles burned as insurance against the inevitable loss of power.
0	2	Later there was a sharp crack as a piece of the tin roof ripped off and water seeped down on the burnished wood tables in the City Council chamber.
0.326923076923077	2	Phone and electric service to the city command post was knocked out.
0	2	During it all, Riley kept in close contact with the National Weather Service.
0.163461538461538	2	As the eye of the storm passed, he took reporters onto the porch of the 188-year-old brick City Hall to look at the damage.
0	2	The initial view, sketched out in the glow of flashlights, was unsettling: The tin roof was tossed in the gutter, slate tiles were scattered on the ground.
0	2	Bricks, sticks and leaves littered the street.
0	2	This is the eye of the hurricane.
0	2	I've never been in one and I hope I'm never in one again, Riley said.
0	2	It's scarcely a late summer breeze.
0.146551724137931	2	As the storm died before dawn, Riley was out on the streets again in a raincoat carrying a flashlight to get a better assessment of the damage.
0	2	Serious but fixable, the mayor concluded.
0.411290322580645	3	Supercomputers, satellites and the expertise of several hurricane forecasters predicted the destructive path Hurricane Hugo would follow, giving people plenty of time to flee the South Carolina coast.
0	3	But hurricane tracking remains an uncertain science.
0.160377358490566	3	Forecasters at the National Hurricane Center used computer models to track Hugo's path into Charleston, S.C. All the world's knowledge about meteorological conditions and forecasting changes in those conditions is embodied in those models, said Thomas Pyke, head of National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's satellite service.
0.17	3	Pinpointing the exact point of Hugo's landfall was difficult, but forecasters said Friday that the landfall was predicted in time for evacuation.
0.242857142857143	3	Overall, I think the tracking models gave us a very good idea where Hugo would be so officials in South Carolina could act in a timely manner, said research meteorologist Colin McAdie.
0.283333333333333	3	The real forecasting problem with Hugo was predicting the intensity of the storm, which was upgraded to a Category 4 hurricane just hours before it slammed into Charleston.
0	3	It is very difficult to predict changes in intensity because we don't have very reliable computer models for that, McAdie said.
0	3	We really need to improve on our forecasting ability of strength.
0	3	The hurricane specialists were surprised by the last-minute increase in wind speed, which was reported to them by Air Force reconnaissance.
0	3	Hurricane specialist Gil Clark, who has tracked hurricanes for 35 years, said that a couple of decades ago, the only forecasting tools were reports from aircraft or ships.
0	3	We had no radar or satellites then, so needless to say our forecasts were less accurate, Clark said.
0	3	In the late 1960s, the weather service began using satellites to obtain a global weather picture.
0.202380952380952	3	Information from the satellite is used to improve the accuracy of the large-scale models that television viewers see every night.
0	3	Using the information from the satellite, supercomputers at the National Meteorological Center in Suitland, Md., send information to the hurricane center where a tracking model constantly changes to account for current weather conditions and the position of the hurricane.
0.141666666666667	3	To determine the track of the storm, the forecasters analyze supercomputer predictions, satellite data, the history of similar storms and the current path of the hurricane.
0	3	Then they make an educated guess about the landfall.
0	3	Meteorology professor Kerry A. Emmanuel of the Massachussetts Institute of Technology criticizes the current forecasting system.
0	3	Congress and the American people are suffering from the collective delusion that our data problems have been solved by satellites and that just isn't true, Emmanuel said.
0	3	Satellites can give a pretty picture, he said, but not enough information about the wind and temperatures that affect a hurricane's path.
0	3	Most of the information actually used to predict hurricanes comes from flying airplanes into the hurricane, and they do a very good job, Emmanuel said.
0	3	Forecasters say the accuracy of satellite pictures is improving every year so long-range forecasting should become more precise.
0.257575757575758	3	We have to remember that those models used are only guidance products, Pyke said, and that it's ultimately the job of the forecaster to predict the storm's path.
0.472222222222222	4	Residents took forecasters at their word when they warned of Hurricane Hugo's fury, and the low number of deaths from the powerful storm can be credited to this healthy respect, authorities said.
0.944444444444444	4	The storm, which caused billions in damage, claimed 17 lives in South Carolina, and only two were in the Charleston area, which bore the brunt of Hugo's 135 mph winds.
0	4	We just feel very thankful about that, said Mayor Joseph P. Riley Jr. Several thousands of people who were in the shelters and the tens of thousands of people who evacuated inland were potential victims of injury and death.
0.404761904761905	4	Riley and other officials credited residents with monitoring the hurricane as it spun toward Charleston, and heeding evacuation warnings.
0.554347826086957	4	The last big storm to hit South Carolina was Hurricane David in 1979, which hit the coast after pounding southern Florida.
0	4	Since then several big storms have threatened but veered away, and officials were worried that Charlestonians wouldn't heed Hugo's warnings.
0	4	We've had so many close calls, said Gary Garnet, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service.
0	4	But this storm was very, very strong, he said.
0	4	This time they realized it.
0.369565217391304	4	Glen Ellis, a Red Cross official, estimated that 18,000 residents in Charleston and the three surrounding counties headed for shelters.
0	4	Tens of thousands more got into their cars and headed up Interstate 26 toward Columbia.
0.193181818181818	4	Mayor John Bourne of North Charleston, where there apparently were no storm-related deaths, credited people for heeding the warnings.
0	4	It was bad, but it could have been a lot worse, he said.
0	4	You've just got to say nice things about the people.
0	4	Meanwhile, Garnet had some good news for storm-weary Charlestonians: late Saturday the tropics were quiet with no other storms brewing.
0	4	There's nothing to worry about out there, he said.
0.177083333333333	5	It's taken the devastation caused by Hurricane Hugo to stimulate repayment of a 211-year-old debt between two cities almost 1,000 miles apart.
0.739130434782609	5	As a way of repaying a kindness dating to 1778, Kingston is raising money to help Charleston, S.C., recover.
0.643939393939394	5	After Kingston, then New York's capital, was burned in October 1777 by the British, New York Gov. George Clinton received a letter from South Carolina Gov. Abraham Livingston.
0.5	5	The letter included nearly 1,000 New York pounds to help Kingston residents get through their crisis.
0.0944444444444445	5	This money has been received for the charitable purpose of alleviating the distresses of the now-indigent inhabitants of the town of Kingston, who by the ravages of the enemy are reduced to poverty and want, Livingston wrote on March 31, 1778.
0.53125	5	Kingston Historian Edwin Ford remembered the letter when Hurricane Hugo ravaged the Carolinas last week.
0	5	I figured they helped us, we should do something for them, Ford said.
0	5	On Wednesday, a local Red Cross chapter began collecting donations for victims of the hurricane.
0	5	A lot of people have been calling, asking to send donations down there, said Susan Lawlor, executive director of the Ulster County Chapter of the Red Cross.
0.34	5	On Tuesday, New York state sent two airplanes full of food, clothing and water to parts of the Caribbean ravaged by Hugo.
0.177083333333333	5	A New York National Guard C-5A cargo plane also left Tuesday to pick up equipment in Mississippi and take it to Puerto Rico.
0	5	Another cargo plane was scheduled to leave Stewart Air Force Base in Newburgh, taking 70 tons of food, water and other supplies to Puerto Rico.
0.283333333333333	6	Hurricane Hugo advanced faster and with renewed fury today on Georgia and South Carolina as 150,000 coastal residents grabbed what they could carry and fled inland on jammed highways.
0	6	not going to take any chances," said Lamar Davis, a bartender on St. Simons Island off southern Georgia, who stole a last glance at the pounding surf before leaving with his wife and 4-year-old daughter.
0.103658536585366	6	The leading edge of Hugo, whose winds muscled up to 125 m.p.h. from 105 m.p.h. the day before, was most likely to hit between Savannah, Ga., and Charleston any time after 8 p.m., local time.
0	6	A hurricane warning was in effect between Fernandina Beach, Fla., and Oregon Inlet, N.C.
0.265625	6	At 3 p.m., Hugo was 220 miles from Savannah and bearing down at 20 m.p.h.
0	6	It was expected to turn gradually to the north, according to the National Weather Service.
0	6	Tidal Surge Feared
0.236111111111111	6	The timing of the landfall was critical because of the storm's tidal surge, a dome of water 10 to 15 feet high that would feed a normal 5-foot tide that peaks after 2 a.m.
0.101190476190476	6	top of that will be waves, and so barrier islands many places the buildings will be swept clean off of those islands," Bob Sheets, director of the National Hurricane Center, said from Coral Gables, Fla.
0	6	Evacuees queued up at gasoline stations and stripped store shelves of bottled water, bread and batteries.
0	6	Officials warned coastal dwellers not to linger because gale force winds and flash floods could block escape routes.
0	6	Five to 10 inches of rain is expected.
0.265625	6	The Navy moved ships out of coastal harbors to ride out the storm at sea.
0	6	Army bases in coastal states moved helicopters inland or into shelters.
0.274193548387097	6	In South Carolina, which was in a state of emergency, Gov. Carroll Campbell dispatched 400 National Guardsmen to assist a mandatory evacuation of coastal barrier islands and shorefront.
0	6	About one-fifth of the state's 3.1 million residents live in eight coastal counties.
0	6	Resort Streets Deserted
0	6	By early afternoon, the wind-swept streets of the resort island of Hilton Head were deserted.
0	6	Store windows were fortified with boards and most homes were empty.
0	6	State troopers guarded the island's entrance.
0	6	brought our photo albums and our important papers," said Pat Bross, who had stopped for gas while heading from Hilton Head to Augusta, Ga., with her husband.
0	6	The Georgia Emergency Management Agency opened shelters and advised about 142,000 people more than 95,000 of them in Chatham County to leave their homes.
0	6	Gov. Joe Frank Harris declared a state of emergency in six counties.
0	6	The state's biggest shelters were opened at Georgia Southern College in Statesboro, with room for 15,500, and the Veterans Administration Medical Center in Dublin, where officials said nearly 19,000 could be housed.
0	6	Coastal school systems canceled classes for the rest of the week.
0.326923076923077	6	Hugo was upgraded to a Category 3 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson scale of strength, indicating that it was powerful enough to cause extensive damage.
0.586206896551724	7	The two dominant home and automobile insurers in the Carolinas said Tuesday that they expect to be hit with about $600 million in claims from Hurricane Hugo.
0.236111111111111	7	Such heavy losses suggest that the storm will be the most expensive ever for the insurance industry.
0.411290322580645	7	State Farm Insurance Co. expects claims as high as $400 million in South Carolina, where it insures one out of every five homes, spokesman Jerry Parsons said.
0.157407407407407	7	The Bloomington, Ill.-based company is also projecting an additional $100 million in claims from storm damage in North Carolina and Virginia, he said.
0.0965909090909091	7	Additionally, Nationwide Insurance Co. said it expects claims close to $100 million, more than triple the $31 million that the company paid for damages caused by Hurricane Elena when it swept through Florida, Alabama and Mississippi in 1985.
0	7	previous all-time high was in 1983, when we paid $165 million in comparable claims for Hurricane Alicia, which struck Galveston and Houston.
0.314814814814815	7	There were a phenomenal number of claims from that storm, but there was not the severity of damage" as in Hugo, Parsons said.
0.335526315789474	7	Officials said property damage from Hugo escalated because the storm scored a direct hit on Charleston and then, instead of heading out to sea, veered northwest, hitting other population centers, including Charlotte, N.C.
0	7	Losses Still Being Tallied
0.5	7	Nationwide, based in Columbus, Ohio, is the biggest home and auto insurance in North Carolina, where damage was unexpectedly high, and is the third-largest insurer in South Carolina.
0	7	have so far received 16,000 claims," spokesman Bob Sohozich said.
0	7	Although claims adjusters are still tallying the losses, there is now little doubt that overall damage to insured property will far exceed the record $752.5 million in claims paid by the industry after Hurricane Frederic struck Mississippi and Alabama in 1979, Parsons said.
0.708333333333333	7	The Insurance Information Institute is expected to issue a report Thursday on overall insured losses from Hugo.
0	7	Although the losses are substantial, they are not expected to threaten the financial health of any individual company because reinsurers will pick up a significant portion of the costs.
0	7	For example, Nationwide said it would be responsible for up to $30 million in claims, while its reinsurers would cover up to $150 million in damages.
0	7	Reinsurers which share a portion of the risk on an insurance policy in exchange for part of the premium income typically spread their risk over many hundreds of companies.
0.31875	7	Analysts said most of the claims will be borne by mutual insurance companies, which are owned by policyholders, but they noted that losses from Hurricane Hugo would also affect the short-term earnings of some publicly traded companies.
0.146551724137931	7	Continental Corp. said it expects to report a pretax charge of $50 million for the third quarter, reflecting its net exposure to damages from the storm.
0	7	The New York-based company had substantial business in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, where Hugo first struck with devastating force.
0	7	Forecasts May Be Cut
0.163461538461538	7	The charge might push Continental into the red for the quarter, said Udayan Ghose, an analyst with Shearson Lehman Hutton in New York.
0	7	there is a profit, it will be a very small one," he said.
0	7	The charge will cut expected annual earnings by close to 25%, he added.
0	7	Ghose said Shearson may also cut its third-quarter and annual earnings projections for Cigna Corp., USF&amp;G Corp. and Lincoln National Corp., which are expected to suffer hurricane-related losses equal to about 10% of expected full-year earnings.
0.34	7	Overall 1989 catastrophic losses for the industry now total about $1.6 billion, and analysts expect Hugo to make this year the costliest.
0	7	But could be a positive for the industry," Ghose said, explaining that the industry is in the middle of a price war because it is overcapitalized.
0.265625	7	Billions of dollars in losses from Hugo and other catastrophes this year would have significant impact on excess capital," he said, causing insurance firms to raise prices shortly.
0	7	would be good for the companies and shareholders," he said.
0.344594594594595	8	Hurricane Hugo will go down in the record books as the costliest storm insurers have faced so far, but it won't cause property-casualty premium rates to rise immediately, analysts and company officials say.
0.303571428571429	8	The property claims service division of the American Insurance Service Group, a trade association, is expected to announce its estimate of total insured losses tomorrow.
0	8	will be the biggest hurricane loss on record," said one official, far surpassing the $752.5 million insurers paid out after Frederick ripped through several Gulf Coast states in 1979.
0	8	The impact on premium rates could be minimal for now, analysts expect, because the biggest losses will be in the personal insurance area for homes and autos.
0	8	Most companies typically set aside funds from premiums they collect every year to cover claims they might have to pay in the future.
0	8	In the last three years, hurricane and storm seasons have been relatively mild, so insurers haven't had to dip into these funds.
0	8	And since Hugo also stormed through the Caribbean, foreign insurers are at risk for some of the damage on those islands.
0	8	Yet, some analysts believe Hugo's huge losses will make a dent in the industry's capital and crimp cash flow; that could make insurers less likely to slash premium rates further in coming months.
0	8	Rates have been falling since late 1986.
0	8	Udayan Ghose at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. believes these reasons might cause rates to edge higher by mid-1990.
0.277173913043478	8	For the time being, the losses from Hugo be substantial, but they won't be something the industry can't handle," said Charles L. Ruoff, director of strategic planning at Fred S. James Co., a New York-based insurance broker.
0.303571428571429	8	For instance, State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co. estimates it will pay claims totaling more than $400 million to homeowners and for some small businesses.
0	8	Nationwide Insurance Co., a mutual company based in Columbus, Ohio, said Hugo the single largest claims disaster" it has seen in its 63-year history.
0.411290322580645	8	The company, which is the largest home and auto insurer in North Carolina and No. 3 in South Carolina, has already received 16,000 claims from the stricken region.
0.386363636363636	8	Claims could total $100 million, a spokesman said.
0.472222222222222	8	For some insurers, Hugo was a double-whammy.
0.0885416666666667	8	New York-based Continental Corp., which is a big insurer in Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands and South Carolinas, said it will take a $50 million pretax charge against earnings this quarter, reflecting its net exposure to the damages caused by the hurricane.
0	8	will be particularly costly to us," said John P. Mascotte, Continental's chairman.
0.177083333333333	8	Philadelphia-based Cigna Corp., which has extensive domestic, foreign and reinsurance operations in the areas Hugo hit, and USF&amp;G Corp. in Baltimore, a big insurer in the Carolina region, could also be forced to take one-time charges against third-quarter earnings, analysts said.
0	8	Some of USF&amp;G's losses hit very close home its Charleston office was destroyed by the hurricane.
0	8	Both USF&amp;G and Cigna declined to predict whether they would take a charge; USF&amp;G said it would be responsible for the first $22.5 million of losses, and its reinsurance would cover the bulk of additional losses.
0	8	Hugo could have a marginal impact on third-quarter income at Travelers Corp., Aetna Life Casualty Insurance Co. and Chubb Corp., according to industry analysts.
0.607142857142857	8	Mr. Ruoff at Fred S. James believes that even if losses from Hugo total as much as $5 billion, insurers won't feel enough pain, such as not being able to pay shareholder dividends," to compel them to boost premium rates right away.
0.118055555555556	8	He explained that in the first six months of this year, net income for the industry declined slightly from 1988, but insurance companies were still earning an adequate rate of return on equity.
0.34	8	He also noted that the industry's aggregate net worth or policyholders' surplus, currently at $125 billion, is also plentiful.
0	8	Generally, insurers can book about $3 of premiums for every $1 of surplus.
0.326923076923077	8	Right now, premiums total about $200 billion, he said.
0	8	An official at Nationwide Insurance noted that the company has $1 of surplus for every $2 of insurance that it writes.
0	8	Insurers also buy protection for themselves through reinsurance by paying another company a portion of the premium to bear some of the losses.
0.447368421052632	8	Michael Lewis at Dean Witter Reynolds said losses from Hugo could be big enough to increase reinsurance rates.
0	8	Although reinsurance will limit the exposure of some companies, the losses they must still cover could hurt third-quarter results.
0.260204081632653	8	Niagara Exchange Corp., based in Buffalo, N.Y., said Monday it will report a loss from operations for the third quarter, and possibly for the year, because of the substantial losses that its Charleston Insurance Co. unit faces as a result of the hurricane.
0.283333333333333	8	State Farm, the nation's largest home insurer, doesn't buy reinsurance.
0	8	It believes its reserves are plentiful enough to absorb its losses, a spokesman said.
0.53125	9	Damage from Hurricane Hugo, which stormed through the Carolinas and the Caribbean last week, will reduce third-quarter earnings for several insurers.
0	9	New York-based American International Group Inc. expects net losses related to Hugo to reduce pretax earnings between $35 million and $45 million.
0	9	Analysts said AIG has told them that it must cover the first $35 million of losses and that its reinsurance agreements will cover the bulk of the remaining damages.
0.223684210526316	9	AIG insured property in Puerto Rico, the eastern Caribbean Islands and the coastal regions of the Carolinas.
0	9	St. Paul Cos., based in St. Paul, Minn, said the pretax cost of Hugo shouldn't exceed $50 million.
0	9	That amount takes into consideration what St. Paul expects to recover under its reinsurance contracts, the company said.
0	9	Philadelphia-based Cigna Corp. is expected to disclose Hugo's likely impact on its earnings sometime today.
0.326923076923077	9	Udayan Ghose, an insurance industry analyst at Shearson Lehman Hutton in New York, estimates that Cigna's third-quarter per-share earnings could be reduced by between 50 cents and 65 cents a share on an after-tax basis.
0	9	That would wipe out 35% to 40% of his $1.40-a-share earnings estimate for the third quarter.
0.425	9	State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co. said its State Fire Casualty Co. unit estimates claim payments from Hugo will exceed $400 million in South Carolina alone, far surpassing the company's record payout for a single disaster.
0.193181818181818	9	When damages in North Carolina and Virginia are added, the company said, the payments will exceed $500 million.
0.137096774193548	9	It said that is more than three times the previous record of $165 million set by Hurricane Alicia, which hit the Houston-Galveston, Texas, area in 1983.

Scientists were elated with the successful launch of space shuttle Discovery with the Hubble Space Telescope ( HST ) aboard on April 24 , 1990 . Deployment of the telescope was originally scheduled for 1983 but was delayed by technical problems and the Challenger accident . Although the communications and electronics systems of the HST still presented some problems , by April 28 the telescope was in orbit 380 miles above the earth 's atmosphere with the potential of providing 10 times better resolution and 25 times more sensitivity than ground-based observatories . The Discovery astronauts were permitted to return to Earth . 
0.143540669856459	0	Two weeks after a failed launch attempt, an improved Discovery is ready to embark on one of the most momentous shuttle missions, hoisting the Hubble Space Telescope high enough to behold the threshold of time.

0	0	You can cut it with a knife, incredible, said Eric Chaisson, senior scientist at the Space Telescope Science Institute at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore.
0	0	Nothing, at least scientifically, seems to have been lost as a result of the two-week wait, one of numerous delays plaguing the mission since its original 1983 launch date.
0	0	As Chaisson remarked last week: The universe has been around for 15 billion years.
0	0	A couple of weeks is not going to matter.
0	0	The heavens look the same to me.
0	0	The secrets are the same, Chaisson said.
0	0	There's not a bit of difference, agreed Charles Pellerin Jr., NASA's director of astrophysics.
0.340909090909091	0	I think the main point is the Hubble Space Telescope still is in perfect condition.
0	0	The $1.5 billion telescope, the most expensive unmanned spacecraft ever built, rests safely inside Discovery's payload bay awaiting the Tuesday launch.
0.0649350649350649	0	If all goes well, Discovery will return to Edwards Air Force Base, Calif., on Sunday, April 29, with an empty payload bay.
0	0	NASA said it may release its first telescope image from Hubble of an open star cluster in the constellation Carina as early as that same day.
0	0	After the early test images are made and other preparatory work is done, Hubble is expected to start providing significant scientific data by satellite in a month or two.
0	0	The observatory is considered the greatest advance in astronomy since Galileo first used a telescope in 1609.
0	0	It also is considered by many at NASA to be the most important shuttle mission to date; it will be the 35th.
0.158102766798419	0	The telescope is named for the late astronomer Edwin P. Hubble, who discovered during the 1920s the universe constantly is expanding.
0	0	His work gave rise to the theory the universe was created by a tremendous explosion about 15 billion years ago.
0.220385674931129	0	From its perch far above Earth's obstructing atmosphere, the telescope will be able to discern objects 50 times fainter and with 10 times greater clarity than the best ground-based observatory.

0.0454545454545455	0	By studying stars and galaxies so distant their light has been traveling to Earth for 14 billion years, they hope to determine the precise origin of the universe and learn whether other solar systems and life forms exist.
0	0	If everything goes well, it's going to knock our socks off, Chaisson said.
0	0	NASA's sole attempt to launch Discovery was halted four minutes before liftoff April 10 when one of the shuttle's three auxiliary power units failed.
0	0	The 88-pound unit was replaced with a new one, the first time NASA ever had installed such a unit at the launch pad.

0.290909090909091	0	The shuttle will follow Hubble from 40 miles away in case a problem develops and the telescope must be retrieved and returned to Earth.
0	0	You can never eliminate those oddball quirks of fate or gremlins that may sneak up on any given day, Sullivan said.
0	0	But those are very remote potentials I really suspect we won't encounter.
0.053475935828877	0	In addition to the $1.5 billion cost of the telescope, $500 million has been spent to stockpile spare parts, train astronauts and develop computer software to operate the instrument.

0.0649350649350649	1	Astronomers are starting to tingle again in anticipation of what the Hubble will be able to accomplish, said Lennard Fisk, head of NASA science activities.
0	1	Air Force forecasters said there was a 90 percent chance the weather would be favorable for launching the shuttle at the scheduled time of 8:31 a.m. EDT.
0	1	More than a half million gallons of liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen were pumped into the space ship's fuel tanks after midnight.
0	1	The astronauts, wearing bright orange flight suits, climbed into the crew cabin just as dawn was breaking over the Kennedy Space Center.
0	1	The $1.5 billion telescope, NASA's costliest cargo, will give astronomers a new set of eyes and ears that we don't have, said William Lenoir, head of NASA's space flight program.
0	1	It's going to change our perspective altogether.
0	1	I can't say what we're going to learn, but I'll be astounded if we don't learn many new things.
0.103896103896104	1	Discovery was aiming for an altitude of 380 miles, the highest a shuttle has ever gone, so the telescope can be placed in its proper orbit far above Earth's distorting atmosphere.
0	1	It is the 35th shuttle mission.
0.0413223140495868	1	Columbia, which journeys into space next month with the Astro observatory, sat on a launch pad 1.6 miles from Discovery, only the second time both pads have been occupied; the first was in 1986 just before the Challenger explosion.
0.578512396694215	1	Hubble has been waiting to take its place in space since 1983, delayed by technical problems and the Challenger accident.
0	1	The latest postponement occurred April 10, when Discovery's launch was scrubbed four minutes before liftoff because of a faulty power unit on the shuttle.
0	1	The mood at the Kennedy Space Center was considerably less festive than during the first launch attempt, when hundreds of astronomers gathered with their families.
0	1	The day after launch, mission specialist Steven A. Hawley will use the shuttle's mechanical arm to lift the 24,250-pound telescope into space.
0	1	Veteran spacewalkers Bruce McCandless II and Kathryn Sullivan will assist if a problem develops.
0	1	Discovery will follow Hubble from 40 miles away for two days until after its lens cap is opened, exposing the finely polished 94.5-inch mirror to starlight.
0	1	Hubble is not expected to start providing scientific data by satellite for a month or more after liftoff.
0	1	However, NASA said it will release its first image an open star cluster in the constellation Carina a week after launch.
0	1	In addition to the $1.5 billion cost of Hubble, $500 million has been spent on spare parts, astronaut training and computer software to operate the instrument.

0.945454545454545	1	During its 15-year working lifetime, the telescope will provide astronomers with 10 times better resolution and 25 times more sensitivity than ground-based observatories.
0	1	As a result, they will be able to study stars and galaxies so distant their light has been traveling toward Earth for 14 billion years.
0	1	Astronomers hope to learn whether the universe was created 15 billion years ago as believed and uncover some of the mystery surrounding galaxies, black holes and quasars.
0	1	Hubble also is expected to shed light on how and when the universe might end.
0.158102766798419	1	The telescope is named for the late astronomer Edwin P. Hubble, who discovered during the 1920s that the universe is expanding.
0	1	His work gave rise to the Big Bang theory that the universe was created by a tremendous explosion.
0	1	In addition to Hubble, Discovery carries a human skull filled with sensors to measure the space radiation that astronauts receive.
0	1	It is the skull's third trip into space.
0	1	The shuttle is to end its five-day mission with a landing at Edwards Air Force Base, Calif.
0.202020202020202	2	Jubilant astronomers saw decades of work take wing Tuesday as the Hubble Space Telescope was boosted high above Earth to launch a great adventure for mankind.
0	2	Charles Robert O'Dell, a Rice University space physicist who has worked 19 years on Hubble, said seeing it hurled into orbit aboard the shuttle capped an experience that was comparable to raising a child.
0	2	I've been with the program since it was a concept.
0	2	There is nothing better than to see 19 years of my work and five of my friends thrust into orbit, he said.
0	2	Colin Norman, a physics and astronomy professor at Johns Hopkins University and academic affairs director of the Space Telescope Science Institute there, called the launch the perfect start to a great adventure for mankind.
0	2	It was incredibly beautiful.
0.101010101010101	2	The power of the launch was awesome and the telescope has an awesome power, Norman said.
0	2	Discovery's liftoff was especially gratifying since it ended seven years of delays.
0.474308300395257	2	The $1.5 billion telescope originally was scheduled for launch in 1983 but remained grounded by technical problems and the Challenger explosion.
0	2	Two weeks ago when hundreds of scientists crowded into the Kennedy Space Center, the launch was scrubbed four minutes before liftoff.
0	2	Only a few dozen of them returned Tuesday, but they were just as excited.
0	2	There were times when we were deeply depressed.
0.0626959247648903	2	There were times when we were elated about Hubble's progress, said William H. Jeffreys, a University of Texas astronomer and Hubble's astrometry project leader.
0	2	This is one of those times when we are thrilled beyond belief.
0.0586510263929619	2	Ed Weiler, NASA program scientist for Hubble, said watching the liftoff was a double whammy because it was my first shuttle launch and the launch of the HST.
0	2	It really gets to you.
0.151515151515151	3	Seven years late, the Hubble Space Telescope is where it belongs, out of this world and in search of others so distant that they may have been formed at the beginning of time.
0.0649350649350649	3	Less than five hours after it rode into space aboard the shuttle Discovery on Tuesday, the $1.5 billion telescope sent its first test radio signal.
0	3	At the sign of life, applause and cheers erupted in Mission Control in Houston.
0	3	As near as we can tell, everything looks perfect, said astronaut Steve Hawley from the shuttle.
0.0956937799043062	3	Hawley's job on Wednesday will be to drop the telescope overboard for a 15-year stay in space.
0.160427807486631	3	Discovery, trailing an arc of white smoke into a brilliant blue sky, carried the silver-colored telescope to an orbit 380 miles above Earth higher by 70 miles than any previous shuttle.
0.0757575757575757	3	There the Hubble will stay to search for yet-unseen wonders of creation with instruments that can look 14 billion years backward in time.
0	3	Our window on the universe!
0.113636363636364	3	NASA launch commentator George Diller exulted as the Discovery rose off its seaside launch pad.
0.170454545454545	3	It's a beautiful day to have Hubble Space Telescope in orbit instead of here on Earth like it's been for so many years, said NASA administrator Richard Truly.
0	3	Hubble's in its element and I'm delighted.
0.519480519480519	3	The telescope was supposed to be launched in 1983, but technical problems and the Challenger accident delayed its deployment.
0	3	It suffered a further delay two weeks ago when the countdown was stopped at the four-minutes-to-go point because of a faulty hydraulic unit on the shuttle.
0.0865800865800866	3	While it remained on Earth, the telescope cost $7 million a month to exercise and keep in readiness.
0	3	In its first day in space, that checkout and testing continued remotely under control of the Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland.
0.0982800982800983	3	On hand to watch the Discovery launching was a contingent of scientists who have hailed the Hubble as the greatest advance in astronomy since Galileo raised a small telescope to his eyes nearly 400 years ago.
0.0790513833992095	3	Truly referred to the early-day astronomer when he was asked about the long delays in getting the telescope to its working station.
0	3	Somebody the other day said, remembers the day that Galileo picked up his telescope to look at the stars?'
0	3	said Truly, a former shuttle astronaut.
0	3	It doesn't matter what day we launch Hubble, it matters that we do it right.
0.173160173160173	3	The telescope is 43 feet long and 14 feet in diameter, about the size of a railroad tank car.
0	3	When it flies free, it will receive electrical power for its six scientific instruments from two wing-like solar arrays that extend outward on each side.
0	3	It is named after the late astronomer Edwin P. Hubble, who theorized that the universe was expanding and that the farther away a galaxy is, the faster it is traveling.
0	3	That gave support to the theory that a massive explosion the Big Bang created the universe 10 to 20 billion years ago.
0.0909090909090909	3	The Hubble is expected to help provide the answer to two major questions: How old is the universe?
0	3	How big is it?
0.106951871657754	3	The telescope has two mirrors, one 94.5 inches in diameter, the other 12 inches.
0	3	Two of the instruments are cameras, two are spectrometers and one is a photometer.
0	3	In addition, the fine pointing system acts as a sixth instrument by providing precise measurement of distances.
0	3	On Wednesday, Hawley is to grapple the 12{-ton telescope with the shuttle's mechanical arm, lift it out of the cargo bay, point it, and after a long checkout drop it overboard to orbit on its own.
0.12987012987013	3	In the cargo bay, the telescope receives electrical power from the shuttle.
0	3	But the juice is cut when the instrument is lifted out and it will depend on internal batteries until the solar panels are extended to receive light from the sun.
0	3	Should the solar panels not deploy, mission specialists Bruce McCandless and Kathryn Sullivan will be standing by, partially dressed in space suits, ready to go into the open cargo bay to unfurl the arrays manually.
0	3	Discovery's launch was not without its problems.
0	3	With 31 seconds left in the countdown, the computer that runs the final moments before liftoff refused to close a fuel valve and stopped the launch process.
0	3	The problem was overcome and the shuttle lifted off at 8:34 a.m. EDT, about three minutes late.
0	3	The shuttle is scheduled to land Sunday at 9:49 a.m. EDT at Edwards Air Force Base in California.
0	3	On the way uphill, as Commander Loren J. Shriver put it, the shuttle's windshield was splattered with several flecks of things.
0	3	He said the windshield was streaked by the debris and that it also was smeared when the spent booster rockets fell off during the climb to orbit.
0	3	The astronauts also had problems with their UHF radio circuit, and one of the ship's small rear thrusters was inoperative.
0	3	Neither problem was considered serious.
0	4	Already they're saying it's the biggest happening in astronomy since Galileo put his eye to a telescope.
0	4	So, step right up folks, and discover the wonders of the universe.
0	4	See how big it is.
0	4	Learn its age.
0	4	Look at light created 14 billion years ago and arriving at your eye only this instant.
0	4	Ride along to the beginning of everything, almost, to the Big Bang of 10 or 20 thousand million years ago.
0	4	See stars born and see them die.
0	4	Watch galaxies form.
0	4	Follow the flow of gas into the Milky Way's halo.
0	4	Peer deep into the universe, past so many stars in our own galaxy that it would take a person more than a lifetime to count, to a hundred billion other galaxies each with about 200 billion stars.
0.239234449760766	4	For scientists, and then the rest of us, all that becomes possible now that the space shuttle Discovery has carried the Hubble Space Telescope into the sky to see what no one has seen before.
0.0727272727272727	4	The telescope, a silvery tube as long as a tanker truck, has an unmatched ability to detect and capture the faintest light.
0	4	Light, speeding along at 186,000 miles a second, is the messenger of creation.
0	4	Tracking the trail of light from today to the first moments contains all the information we will ever have about the creation of the universe.
0.106951871657754	4	The Hubble promises to give science an open window perhaps to the first echoes of creation.
0	4	This is a world-class event, even if astronomy is not your thing.
0.196560196560197	4	In the history of optical astronomy there have been two great leaps in the resolution of the universe: Galileo's telescope in the autumn of 1609, and the Hubble Space Telescope in April 1990.
0	4	Eric J. Chaisson, a senior scientist at the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore.
0	4	No one ever made anything that good, James Westphal, California Institute of Technology.
0.0699300699300699	4	Dr. Lennard Fisk, NASA's chief scientist, predicts that the Hubble telescope will literally be the dawn of a new era in astronomy.
0	4	Eras rarely can be proclaimed in advance.
0	4	But the HST, named after Edwin Powell Hubble, holds that kind of promise.
0	4	Hubble was an astronomer in the first half of the century who concluded not only that distant galaxies are moving away from Earth but that the farther away they are, the faster they move.
0	4	The theory of an expanding universe supported the belief that the universe originated in a cosmic explosion and that all matter is still rushing from the site of that so-called Big Bang.
0	4	Astronomers think the Big Bang occurred 12 billion to 20 billion years ago and sent the entire universe flying out at incredible speed and heat.
0	4	Eventually matter cooled and condensed into galaxies, stars and planets.
0.053475935828877	4	There are bigger telescopes than the Hubble, but they are all on Earth and all subject to a major limitation the atmosphere which is fine for breathing but lousy for seeing through.
0	4	The problem of skywatching through layers of air has been likened to birdwatching from the bottom of a swimming pool.
0	4	The Voyager spacecraft, which sent back astonishing views of Earth's sister planets, had to travel 12 years to get close enough for pictures as they whizzed past.
0.101010101010101	4	With the Hubble, says scientist Edward Weiler, such pictures are possible any time we want.
0.191387559808612	4	The telescope is 42.5 by 14 feet and consists of a 94.5-inch primary mirror that gathers incoming light.
0.0673400673400673	4	On a clear, dark night you can see a flashlight from two miles away, says Weiler, chief NASA scientist on the Hubble project.
0	4	With a 28-power telescope you can see it on the moon 250,000 miles away.
0	4	With the HST you could see a firefly in Australia from Washington.
0.194805194805195	5	Discovery's astronauts overcame balky equipment to send the Hubble Space Telescope floating free from the shuttle today on a 15-year quest for secrets of the universe.
0.0586510263929619	5	The $1.5 billion telescope began orbiting Earth every 97.3 minutes at an altitude of 380 miles high above the atmosphere, which has limited the view of ground-based telecopes.
0	5	Discovery, go for Hubble release, Mission Control told the crew at 3:37 p.m. EDT.
0	5	The event occurred a minute later as the shuttle slowly and carefully backed away.
0.0649350649350649	5	The final hours before its release were a nightmare for ground controllers as they commanded the unfurling of two solar panels that power the telescope's instruments.
0	5	The starboard panel balked twice as it was being pulled from its reel.
0	5	Mission Control ordered space-walking astronauts to be ready to go out of the cabin to help.
0	5	But there was a third try and it was successful.
0.0757575757575757	5	We have confirmation that the solar array wing on the starboard side has been deployed, the telescope control center in Maryland said.
0.113636363636364	5	So we have good news, said Dave Drachlis, of the Hubble control center.
0.125391849529781	5	The deployment of the two 39-foot panels allowed sun power to flow into the telescope's batteries, relieving worries that they would use up their eight-hour charge.
0	5	Before astronaut Steve Hawley was able to lift the 12{-ton telescope from the cargo bay with the shuttle's mechanical arm, its instruments had to be disconnected from the shuttle's power and shifted over to the batteries.
0.160427807486631	5	Precisely one day after lifting off from Launch Pad 39B at Kennedy Space Center, the Hubble Space Telescope is ready to fly on its own, Mission Control's Jeffrey Carr said.
0	5	The game has begun.
0	5	The race is on.
0	5	The clock is ticking.
0.0519480519480519	5	Astronauts Kathryn Sullivan and Bruce McCandless put on spacesuits and entered an airlock in order to be ready to walk outside and pull out the array had mechanical deployment of the solar panels failed.
0.0586510263929619	5	Cameras aboard Discovery showed the telescope, being held at the end of a 50-foot crane, reflecting sunlight from its silver surface and a turning Earth in the background.
0	5	Earlier this morning, Discovery commander Loren J. Shriver maneuvered the shuttle into its deployment position, with its nose pointed toward the sun.
0.0886917960088692	5	That was to put the telescope's solar arrays, once unfurled, at the proper angle to quickly start collecting energy and protect the telescope's fixed star trackers while the instrument was being held above the payload bay.
0.427807486631016	5	Discovery is in orbit 380 miles above Earth, 70 miles higher than any previous shuttle.
0.101010101010101	5	The orbit was dictated by the need to put the telescope above the Earth's distorting atmosphere.
0	5	For those technically inclined this morning, I'd like to pass on the quote of the day from the on-board astronomer something to the effect that the big marble sure looks far away today, Shriver said.
0	5	The five astronauts' busy day began on a musical note early this morning as Mission Control played a song called Space is Our World, written by members of Discovery's training team and a Houston-area group, Private Numbers.
0.053475935828877	5	Controllers monitoring the telescope at Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland said Tuesday that no problems had been detected so far aboard Hubble, the most expensive and complex unmanned spacecraft ever built.
0	5	Everything has just being going like clockwork, said Ron Schlagheck, shift director of orbital verifications at Goddard.
0	5	Everybody is in excellent spirits.
0.436363636363636	5	The Hubble telescope, delayed by technical problems and the 1986 Challenger accident, has waited seven years to take its place in space.
0	5	It finally got a ride into orbit Tuesday morning aboard Discovery.
0.0826446280991736	5	Hubble will allow astronomers to study stars and galaxies so distant their light has taken 14 billion years to reach Earth.
0	5	It is expected to provide clues to the age and size of the universe, and it may solve the mysteries of quasars, pulsars and black holes and even find stars with planets that could conceivably support life.
0.0826446280991736	5	The 24,250-pound telescope is 43 feet long and 14 feet in diameter, about the size of a railroad tank car.
0.0826446280991736	5	When it is in orbit, it will receive electrical power for its six scientific instruments from two winglike solar arrays.
0	5	It is named for the late astronomer Edwin P. Hubble, whose discovery during the 1920s that the universe is expanding gave rise to the Big Bang theory that the universe was created by a tremendous explosion 10 billion to 20 billion years ago.
0.186480186480186	6	After years of delay and a last-minute snag, the Hubble Space Telescope was freed from the shuttle Discovery on Wednesday and, glinting in the sunlight, drifted into orbit on its 15-year search for new worlds.
0.0606060606060606	6	Mission specialist Steven Hawley released Hubble from the end of the shuttle's 50-foot-long mechanical arm after a delay in getting one of the telescope's solar wings unfurled.
0.0699300699300699	6	The first of NASA's great observatories is now on station at 330 nautical miles above the Earth, Mission Control's Jeffrey Carr said.
0.0626959247648903	6	The telescope really looked great as we flew away from it, and we sure hope it does good work, Discovery commander Loren J. Shriver said later.
0.0586510263929619	6	The $1.5 billion telescope was released at 3:38 p.m. EDT as the shuttle entered its 20th orbit of Earth, nearly two hours and one orbit later than planned.
0	6	The shuttle then backed away.
0	6	Thank you very much for the ride, said Mike Harrington, director of orbital verifications at Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md.
0	6	Mission specialists Bruce McCandless and Kathryn Sullivan had been in the shuttle's airlock, ready to walk inspace to free the solar panel.
0	6	That proved to be unnecessary.
0.0865800865800866	6	Close but no cigar, but better for the Hubble that it went the way it did, Sullivan said.
0	6	She and McCandless had trained for nearly five years to make such a rescue mission.
0	6	The first solar array unreeled from its mast at midday Wednesday as the shuttle passed 380 statute miles, or 330 nautical miles, above South America's eastern coast.
0.0956937799043062	6	It started providing power to the telescope's batteries, which otherwise had only eight hours of charge.
0.151515151515151	6	Deployment of the starboard panel, however, was more troublesome.
0	6	It wouldn't budge when latches were first released, then moved about a fifth of its 39-foot length, and stopped again.
0	6	A third attempt rolled the panel out all the way.
0	6	Houston, we see motion, Commander Loren J. Shriver reported.
0	6	Hawley began the long process of releasing Hubble shortly after 7 a.m. EDT when he grasped it with Discovery's 50-foot-long mechanical arm and carefully hoisted the 12{-ton telescope high above the shuttle.
0	6	Hubble was taken off shuttle electrical power just before it was lifted out of the cargo bay and was operating on its own nickel-hydrogen batteries.
0	6	At one day, seven minutes into the flight of Discovery, Hubble is now on its own internal power, Carr said.
0	6	The game has begun.
0	6	The race is on.
0	6	The clock is ticking.
0.0865800865800866	6	Worries that the telescope's instruments would be starved for electricity eased after the first solar panel was stretched out.
0	6	Television cameras aboard Discovery showed the first array as it was pulled from its reel slowly but steadily, the sun reflecting off the gold-colored panel and silvery telescope.
0.101010101010101	6	Discovery was 380 statute miles above Earth, 70 miles higher than any shuttle has ever flown.
0.101010101010101	6	The orbit was dictated by the need to put the telescope above the Earth's distorting atmosphere.
0.181818181818182	6	Discovery's five astronauts were awed by the view.
0	6	I'd like to pass on the quote of the day from the on-board astronomer something to the effect that the big marble sure looks far away today, Shriver said of Hawley.
0	6	Astronomers have waited seven years for Hubble to take its place in space.
0.432900432900433	6	The telescope originally was scheduled for launch in 1983, but technical problems and the Challenger explosion pushed it back.
0.0505050505050505	6	The mission was delayed another two weeks when a faulty power unit on Discovery forced the National Aeronautics and Space Administration to halt the first launch attempt four minutes before April 10's scheduled liftoff.
0	6	On Tuesday, Discovery finally blasted into space, transporting Hubble out of this world and in search of others.
0.0865800865800866	6	The telescope's 10-foot aperture door is to be opened Friday, exposing the finely polished 94.5-inch mirror to starlight.
0	6	Discovery was following Hubble in case the door does not open properly.
0	6	If a problem develops, McCandless and Sullivan will be prepared once again to walk in space.
0.0699300699300699	6	Fred Wojtalik, Hubble project manager, said the telescope would be tested Thursday for its ability to maneuever before the aperture door is opened.
0.0649350649350649	6	We want to be in full control so we don't ever endanger the Hubble by putting the aperture door close to the sunlight, he said.
0.106951871657754	6	The telescope cannot focus into the sun because of the sensitivity of its five instruments.
0	6	If all goes well, the crew will land Sunday at Edwards Air Force Base, Calif.
0.0826446280991736	6	NASA expects to release its first image from the telescope of an open star cluster in the constellation Carina on Tuesday.
0	6	Data will follow in a month or two.
0.0586510263929619	6	Astronomers hope to look back to almost the beginning of the time, studying stars and galaxies so distant their light has been traveling to Earth for 14 billion years.
0	6	They expect to determine precisely how and when the universe was formed, currently estimated at 15 billion years ago.
0.151515151515151	6	The telescope is named for the late American astronomer Edwin P. Hubble, who discovered during the 1920s that the universe was expanding.
0	6	He also was responsible for helping to form the Big Bang theory of creation.
0.101010101010101	7	Ground controllers at the Goddard Space Flight Center finally made contact today with the two main antennas on the $1.5 billion Hubble Space Telescope after trying for more than six hours to lock on.
0.0673400673400673	7	Applause erupted in the Hubble control center in Greenbelt, Md., as the glitch that marred Hubble's first full day in space was solved.
0	7	We have confirmation that we have achieved communication with the Tracking and Data Relay Satellite through the high-gain antenna system, said NASA's Dave Drachlis.
0	7	Engineers had said all along they believed the antennas were working all right and that the problem was in incorrectly pointing either the satellite or the TDRS, an orbiting communications satellite that acts as a switchboard.
0.0586510263929619	7	In the successful attempt, they nearly doubled the width of the antennas' beams to take in more territory, from a sweep of 6.2 degrees to 10.8 degrees.
0.0673400673400673	7	The telescope's low-gain antennas, which receive and transmit information at a much slower rate and can be used in emergencies, were working well.
0.25974025974026	7	Space shuttle Discovery was 46 miles away, available to remedy certain problems.
0	7	The outage was not a problem for which space walkers would have been summoned.
0.0865800865800866	7	The five astronauts were otherwise busy making pictures of storms over Texas from their 380-mile-high perch, and doing experiments.
0.0606060606060606	7	Steve Terry, director of a team calibrating various aspects of the telescope, said the first outage was caused by human error and was not a serious problem.
0	7	It began between 1 and 1:30 a.m. EDT and lasted 45 minutes to an hour, he said.
0.0727272727272727	7	The second failure occurred at 6:44 a.m. when controllers attempted to send a signal to the telescope's two high-gain antennas through the TDRS.
0.113636363636364	7	This time it was a pointing problem, said Jim Elliott, a Goddard spokesman.
0	7	It's a new spacecraft and we think inexperience dealing with it was the cause.
0.0519480519480519	7	The telescope, embarking on a 15-year search for new worlds, was released from the shuttle's cargo bay Wednesday after a last-minute snag that almost sent two astronauts on an emergency spacewalk.
0	7	Mission Control awakened the crew early today with a loud rendition of the song Shout, a fraternity house favorite.
0	7	Good morning, Discovery.
0	7	I guess you're awake after that song, said Kathy Thornton, shuttle communicator.
0	7	There are a lot of happy people down here.
0	7	We saw a great deploy yesterday and Hubble had a good night while you were asleep.
0	7	We appreciate the good words from everybody, replied Discovery Commander Loren Shriver.
0.0909090909090909	7	After Wednesday's deployment, Shriver gently backed Discovery away from the telescope and put the shuttle through a series of maneuvers, the last one completed this morning, to park Discovery in orbit 46 miles behind Hubble.
0.0727272727272727	7	The telescope really looked great as we flew away from it, and we sure hope it does good work, Shriver said Wednesday.
0	7	Well, it sure is now, Loren, and thanks for all the great work you've done, replied Mission Control.
0	7	Galileo is real proud of you.
0.0586510263929619	7	Scientists have hailed the Hubble NASA's most expensive unmanned spacecraft as the greatest advance in astronomy since Galileo raised a small telescope to his eyes nearly 400 years ago.
0.0626959247648903	7	Discovery and its five astronauts will follow the telescope while controllers at the Goddard center make sure Hubble is operating properly, such as responding to directional commands.
0.0673400673400673	7	The next milestone is Friday, when the telescope's 10-foot aperture door is to be opened, exposing the finely polished 94.5-inch mirror to starlight.
0.0757575757575757	7	Then on Tuesday, NASA expects to release the first image from the telescope: an open star cluster in the constellation Carina.
0	7	Data will follow in a month or two.
0.13986013986014	7	If the aperture door doesn't open properly, Discovery could return to the telescope so two astronauts could perform a spacewalk to fix it.
0.0757575757575757	7	Hubble project manager Fred Wojtalik said the telescope would be tested today for its ability to maneuver before the aperture door is opened.
0.0649350649350649	7	We want to be in full control so we don't ever endanger the Hubble by putting the aperture door close to the sunlight, he said.
0.165289256198347	7	Too much light could damage the telescope's sensitive instruments.
0	7	On Wednesday, mission specialist Steve Hawley used the shuttle's 50-foot robot arm to gently grasp the 12{-ton telescope and hoist it from the cargo bay.
0.113636363636364	7	One of the telescope's solar arrays unreeled from its mast as expected and started providing power to the telescope's batteries, which otherwise had only eight hours of charge.
0	7	But there was trouble with the second panel.
0	7	It wouldn't budge when the latches were released, and then moved about a fifth of its 39-foot length and stopped again.
0	7	The panel rolled all the way out on the third attempt.
0	7	By the final attempt, astronauts Bruce McCandless and Kathryn Sullivan were in their space suits in the airlock, 30 minutes away from taking tools in hand and going on an outer-space maintenance call.
0	7	Wojtalik said the cause of the problem is unknown.
0.158102766798419	7	The 8{-hour procedure was performed 380 miles above Earth, 70 miles higher than any shuttle has ever flown.
0	7	The orbit was dictated by the need to put Hubble above the Earth's distorting atmosphere.
0.106951871657754	7	Astronomers hope to use the telescope to look back to almost the beginning of the time, studying stars and galaxies so distant their light has taken 14 billions years to reach Earth.
0	7	They hope to determine how and when the universe was formed, currently estimated at 15 billion years ago.
1	7	The telescope originally was scheduled for launch in 1983 but was delayed by technical problems and the Challenger accident.
0	7	Discovery, which blasted into orbit Tuesday, is scheduled to land Sunday at Edwards Air Force Base, Calif.
0.181818181818182	8	Ground controllers cheered after re-establishing contact Thursday with the $1.5 billion Hubble Space Telescope through its main antennas.
0	8	An attempt six hours earlier had failed.
0	8	I'm pretty relieved, I must say, said Al Boggess, Hubble project scientist at Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md.
0	8	Applause erupted at Goddard's Space Telescope Operations Control Center when the high-speed contact was made Thursday afternoon.
0.110192837465565	8	Controllers sent information to the telescope about its location, and this basically improved the telescope's knowledge where it was, what its position was, said Goddard's Dave Drachlis.
0	8	They also widened the radio beam to cover a larger area around the two high-speed dish antennas.
0	8	We have confirmation that we have achieved communication with the Tracking and Data Relay Satellite through the high-gain antenna system, Drachlis reported.
0	8	The antennas are the primary communications links for relaying scientific information to the ground.
0.101010101010101	8	Controllers' lack of experience with the new satellite was part of the problem, Boggess said.
0.113636363636364	8	This probably won't be the last time we have a problem, he said.
0	8	We'll keep working at it until we have all these things that need to be done, done.
0	8	We'll get them right.
0	8	The problem began Thursday morning when engineers tried pointing the two high-speed antennas toward two widely-separated TDRS satellites without success.
0	8	Two low-speed antennas were working fine, but Boggess said they would be excruciatingly slow for sending data.
0.165289256198347	8	There had been a communications outage with the telescope earlier.
0	8	It lasted only 45 minutes and was due to human error.
0.0505050505050505	8	In addition, one of four rate gyros, wheels whose spin maintains the telescope in a stable position, was disconnected by an automatic system for a reason engineers were unable to explain immediately.
0	8	But it was restored later and the stability of the satellite was unaffected.
0.113636363636364	8	The problems won't delay the schedule for putting the telescope into use, said Jean Oliver, Hubble deputy project manager at Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Ala.
0	8	Now we have to do an analysis to make sure ourselves just what part of it worked and whether there are things we have to do differently in the future to make it continue to work, Boggess said.
0	8	Having done it once, we've got confidence we can do it and that means the mission can proceed.
0.25974025974026	8	Space shuttle Discovery trailed 57 miles behind the telescope and was to stay nearby until the Hubble's aperture door was opened, set for Friday morning.
0.0550964187327824	8	Its five astronauts spent the day doing experiments and taking pictures of storms over Texas and other views of Earth from 380 miles up, the highest a shuttle has ever flown.
0.145454545454545	8	When the door covering the telescope aperture is opened, starlight will strike the telescope's finely polished 94.5-inch mirror for the first time.
0	8	If signals fail to activate the 10-foot-wide aluminum aperture door, mission specialists Bruce McCandless and Kathryn Sullivan will go into open space and crank it open Saturday.
0	8	The shuttle is scheduled to land Sunday at Edwards Air Force Base, Calif.
0	8	The mission would be extended a day if the space walk became necessary.
0.0699300699300699	8	On Tuesday, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration releases its first image from the telescope, an open star cluster in the constellation Carina.
0	8	Scientific data will follow in a month or two.
0	8	The 12{-ton, 43-foot-long telescope, about the size of a bus, is named for astronomer Edwin P. Hubble, who died in 1953.
0	8	The Missouri-born Hubble discovered during the 1920s that the universe is expanding, a finding that gave rise to the theory the universe was created about 15 billion years ago by a tremendous explosion.
0	8	Astronomers expect to look back 14 billion years with the space telescope.
0.294840294840295	9	The lens cover on the Hubble Space Telescope opened today after a morning of worrisome problems, and Mission Control told the Discovery astronauts they no longer are needed to rescue the $1.5 billion instrument.
0	9	You've been released from Hubble support; it's on its own, Mission Control told the astronauts when the aluminum aperture door opened.
0	9	Thank you, sir, that's great news, said Discovery Commander Loren J. Shriver.
0.113636363636364	9	There are handshakes and smiles all around up here, said Steve Hawley, who had been at the controls when the telescope was released into its own orbit on Wednesday.
0	9	I'll bet it's just that way down there, too.
0.363636363636364	9	The successful opening of the lens cover paved the way for the astronauts to return to Earth on Sunday.
0.0909090909090909	9	They had blasted into space Tuesday after a two-week delay and dispatched the telescope from its payload bay Wednesday.
0.13986013986014	9	The Hubble is open for business, Mission Control told the astronauts.
0.404040404040404	9	The telescope still was having problems, however.
0	9	When the door opened, two of its four position-stabilizing gyroscopes stopped working and the electronic system went into an automatic safe mode in which all motion is stopped.
0.0956937799043062	9	The team at the Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland, which guides the telescope, said the door-opening motion jarred the telescope more than had been expected and that the system reacted properly in shutting down.
0.0956937799043062	9	By early afternoon, a step-by-step procedure was begun to bring the telescope's electronics back on line.
0.0550964187327824	9	Steve Terry, a top Hubble engineering official, said tolerances for the telescope systems had been set particularly narrow for the first operations and that was the cause of many malfunctions.
0	9	In addition to the trouble this morning, there two communications outages Thursday totaling several hours.
0	9	We're cautious, and that's natural, he said.
0	9	We've got a very expensive spacecraft here and we don't want to do anything to jeopardize the usefulness.
0	9	We'll get to the point where we know exactly what the spacecraft will do and set the limits appropriately.
0.27972027972028	9	NASA announced that at this time the telescope is safe, stable.
0.269360269360269	9	The space shuttle Discovery, which carried the telescope to orbit, was 50 miles behind the telescope, ready to lend a hand if needed.
0	9	Later in the day, the ship was to do an engine firing that would set it on a preliminary path for home.
0.303030303030303	9	That path would take the Discovery two miles below the telescope.
0.0909090909090909	9	The lens cover, a 10-foot diameter aperature door, covers the opening to the telescope's light shield.
0.363636363636364	9	When it is closed, the telescope is blind.
0.125391849529781	9	The lens cover had been closed except for a tiny wedge opening ever since the $1.5 billion telescope was dropped overboard by the Discovery crew on Wednesday.
0	9	Now that it is opened, starlight can strike the lens for the first time and it can go about its business of photographing and analyzing the universe in ways and with sensitivity never before possible.
0	9	The door is made from honeycombed aluminum sheets covered on the outside with solar-reflecting material.
0	9	The inside is painted black to absorb stray light.
0.151515151515151	9	If the door opening command had failed, the five Discovery astronauts who deployed Hubble were prepared to head back to the telescope.
0	9	Mission specialists Bruce McCandless and Kathryn Sullivan would have performed a space walk to open the door Saturday if necessary.
0.0626959247648903	9	If it had been needed, the rescue would have delayed the landing, scheduled for Sunday at Edwards Air Force Base, Calif., by a day.
0.0865800865800866	9	The astronauts were awakened at 2:30 a.m. EDT to the mellow sounds of the Beach Boys' song, Kokomo.
0	9	For Max Q's keyboard, that's the way that song should really be done, Mission Control radioed to mission specialist Steve Hawley, a member of the all-astronaut band called Max Q. Your next practice is Sunday evening in the gym, don't be late.
0	9	Max Q is a NASA acronym for the point in the shuttle's ascent when the aerodynamic pressure is at its greatest point.
0	9	That sounds just like the way we do it, replied Hawley.
0	9	If you get us home by Sunday, I'll go to practice.
0.053475935828877	9	In an orbit high enough to avoid Earth's distorting atmosphere, Hubble will allow astronomers to study stars and galaxies so distant their light has taken 14 billion years to reach Earth.
0.25974025974026	9	It is capable of detecting objects 50 times fainter and with 10 times greater clarity than the best ground-based observatory.
0	9	During its 15-year working lifetime, Hubble is expected to help determine the age and size of the universe.
0	9	It may solve the mysteries of quasars, pulsars and black holes and even find stars with planets that could conceivably support life.
0.0757575757575757	9	On Tuesday, NASA plans to release its first test image from the telescope, an open star cluster in the constellation Carina.
0	9	Significant data will follow in a month or two.
0	9	The 12{-ton, 43-foot-long telescope, about the size of a bus, is named for astronomer Edwin P. Hubble, who died in 1953.
0	9	The Missouri-born Hubble discovered during the 1920s that the universe is expanding, a finding that gave rise to the theory the universe was created about 15 billion years ago by a tremendous explosion.
0.213903743315508	10	The Hubble Space Telescope orbited with its big eye open Friday after ground controllers overcame communications problems and lifted its lens cover, but its electronics were shut down due to a malfunction.
0.363636363636364	10	Those problems, however, were not the immediate concern of shuttle Discovery's astronauts, who prepared for Sunday's return to Earth.
0	10	You've been released from Hubble support.
0	10	It's on its own, Mission Control's Story Musgrave told the five crew members.
0	10	That's great news, replied Discovery commander Loren J. Shriver.
0	10	There are handshakes and smiles all around up here.
0	10	I'll bet it's just that way back down there, too, added mission specialist Steven Hawley.
0	10	Who's buying tonight?
0	10	We'll buy when you all get back, Musgrave replied.
0	10	Flight director William Reeves said it was too early to cheer.
0	10	still have an important part of the mission to go, Reeves said.
0	10	We reserve our celebration until the crew is safely on the ground.
0	10	Discovery is to land at 9:48 a.m. EDT Sunday at Edwards Air Force Base, Calif.
0.106951871657754	10	Landing would have been delayed a day if astronauts Bruce McCandless and Kathryn Sullivan had had to perform a space walk to crank open the telescope's lens cover, or aperture door.
0.188087774294671	10	The shuttle trailed 50 miles behind Hubble when the aperture door opened 380 miles above Earth, but passed 3.7 miles beneath the telescope later in the day.
0	10	The National Aeronautics and Space Administration had planned to release its first test image from the $1.5 billion telescope on Tuesday, showing an open star cluster in the constellation Carina.
0.165289256198347	10	But Steve Terry, director of orbital verifications, said that would be delayed by problems with Hubble's high-speed antennas.
0	10	Scientific data will follow in a month or two.
0	10	Hubble's 10-foot aluminum aperture door was opened to the heavens at 10:30 a.m. EDT, nearly four hours later than planned, exposing its finely polished 94.5-inch mirror to starlight for the first time.
0.0932400932400932	10	Ground controllers sent a signal commanding the door to lift even though the telescope was in an automatic safe mode, with all motion stopped because of problems in linking its high-speed dish antennas with a relay satellite.
0.0673400673400673	10	One of the two antennas apparently had swung too far, and the telescope shut down, said Jean Oliver, a Hubble deputy project manager.
0.117302052785924	10	If future movements of the antenna have to be limited to avoid the problem, it would have only slight impact on the telescope's observing time, Oliver said.
0.113636363636364	10	Terry said the opening of the aperture door could not have been delayed much longer.
0	10	There has to be a point where you say they have to go their way and we have to go ours, he said of the astronauts.
0	10	When the door opened, two of Hubble's four position-stabilizing gyroscopes stopped working; later, engineers got them back on line.
0	10	The motion of the lens cover knocked out the gyros, said Dave Drachlis of the Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland.
0	10	That, too, kept it in the safe mode.
0.202020202020202	10	Oliver said it would be Saturday morning before the telescope is brought out of the safe mode.
0	10	It will take another day to get the instrument operating normally again, putting controllers at Goddard several days behind.
0	10	We're trying to be very deliberate and trying not to cut any corners and do anything fast because we feel there's a lot at risk here and we want to make sure we're doing it properly, Oliver said.
0	10	We've got a long future ahead of us, and we want to make sure it starts off on the right foot.
0.303030303030303	10	NASA said the telescope was safe and in a stable position.
0.0727272727272727	10	Tolerances for the telescope systems were set particularly narrow for the first operations and that was the cause of many malfunctions, Terry said.
0	10	In addition to that trouble, there were two communications outages totaling several hours.
0	10	We're cautious, and that's natural, Terry said.
0	10	We've got a very expensive spacecraft here and we don't want to do anything to jeopardize the usefulness.
0	10	We'll get to the point where we know exactly what the spacecraft will do and set the limits appropriately.
0	10	Terry said Hubble is designed with safe modes so it can be the master of its own destiny in case contact with an orbiting communications system is lost for extended periods.
0.0909090909090909	10	The telescope will share the system, known as Tracking and Data Relay Satellites, with other space craft.
0.0673400673400673	10	Except for a tiny wedge opening, the lens cover had been closed and the telescope blind ever since Hubble was released by the astronauts Wednesday.
0.0519480519480519	10	From its orbit high above Earth's distorting atmosphere, the telescope will enable astronomers over its 15-year working lifetime to look back 14 billion years and possibly determine the age of the universe.
0	10	The universe is believed to have been created about 15 billion years ago in a cosmic explosion.
0.145454545454545	10	The late astronomer Edwin P. Hubble, for whom the telescope is named, provided the basis for the Big Bang theory of creation.
0	10	He discovered during the 1920s that the universe is expanding and that the farther the galaxy is from Earth, the faster it is moving away.
0	10	In honor of the astronomer, Sullivan carried with her into space an eyepiece from the 100-inch telescope at California's Mount Wilson Observatory that Hubble used to make his pioneering observations.
0	10	It's a great pleasure to have something of such historical significance and something that so directly symbolizes Edwin Hubble's fundamental contributions to astronomy, she said Friday afternoon.
0.12987012987013	10	Once back on Earth, the eyepiece will be displayed at the observatory.
0.147420147420147	11	The Hubble Space Telescope was awakened from its self-induced sleep today but it was still without the use of its high-speed antennas, and its science instruments were on hold, unable to begin any observations.
0.0865800865800866	11	We are out of the right now, said Steve Terry, a supervisor of the engineers controlling the telescope.
0.151515151515151	11	He said the telescope was running on a normal control-all mode, where its own computers and sensors guide where it is pointing.
0.117302052785924	11	Discovery's astronauts, meanwhile, packed their gear for a return to Earth Sunday, made some last-minute observations of Earth and talked with ground-based reporters about their flight.
0.0505050505050505	11	Pilot Charles Bolden said he was especially upbeat about the widespread public awareness of the telescope, which is expected eventually to look back 14 billion light years nearly to the birth of the universe.
0.247933884297521	11	It's hard to go somewhere and find someone who has never heard of the Hubble Space Telescope, said Bolden.
0	11	It makes little kids' eyes light up.
0	11	It makes little kids want to learn how to add and subtract and study science.
0.0505050505050505	11	The telescope's big eye has remained open, but Hubble had been in a safe mode with all motion stopped because of earlier problems in linking the high-speed dish antennas with a relay satellite.
0	11	The antennas are the primary links for relaying scientific data to the ground.
0.0886917960088692	11	Terry said that even in the safe mode, one of the tape recorders in the telescope reads telemetry signals from all its systems and that these would be played to Earth and analyzed when the antennas are working properly.
0	11	We expect to use that data to investigate what happened, he said.
0.103896103896104	11	Engineers are able to send commands to the telescope via its secondary antennas but the communications system is not useful for scientific data, which must be transmitted at a high rate of speed.
0	11	We're putting the scientific instruments in a hold mode, in effect a standby mode, he said.
0.0386847195357834	11	Shortly after 6 a.m. EDT, controllers at the Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md., completed a series of commands that took the telescope out of its safe mode and then began to run a 12-hour computer program to monitor Hubble's health.
0.0519480519480519	11	It will take another day before the $1.5 billion telescope is operating the way it was supposed to at this point in the startup process, said Hubble deputy project manager Jean Olivier.
0.0865800865800866	11	We're backing up to a very deliberate and slow and careful approach to these problems, Olivier said Friday.
0	11	This is not the time to do anything dumb.
0.0649350649350649	11	The telescope problems have put the flight center several days behind, but the five astronauts who deployed it earlier this week were sticking to their schedule.
0.0649350649350649	11	Landing is scheduled for 9:48 a.m. EDT Sunday at Edwards Air Force Base, Calif., but flight controllers were keeping a close watch on the weather.
0	11	Winds were predicted to be about 20 mph with gusts up to 29 mph.
0	11	Mission rules dictate that headwinds cannot exceed 29 mph at touchdown.
0.0956937799043062	11	The shuttle carries enough supplies to stay in orbit three days beyond Sunday if necessary, NASA said.
0	11	Mission Control awakened the crew members at about 1:30 a.m. EDT today by playing the song, Cosmos.
0	11	Thanks for the wake-up music, it's pretty appropriate for today, said Commander Loren Shriver.
0.145454545454545	11	The song was selected in honor of Hubble Space Telescope, which is now open for business, said Mission Control commentator James Hartsfield.
0.101010101010101	11	The astronauts were to finish up their experiments and photography today and pack for the trip home.
0	11	They also planned to hold a news conference from space with reporters at the Johnson Space Center.
0.181818181818182	11	Shriver and pilot Charles Bolden were to run through a series of tests to make certain the shuttle's computers and control jets were ready for return to Earth.
0.0757575757575757	11	The crew deployed Hubble on Wednesday but they had stayed close to the telescope in case there was trouble opening the aperture door.
0.34965034965035	11	Mission specialists Bruce McCandless and Kathryn Sullivan were prepared to perform a space walk today to crank it open in orbit 380 miles above Earth.
0.0673400673400673	11	But that proved unnecessary when the door was opened Friday morning, exposing the telescope's finely polished 94.5-inch eye to starlight for the first time.
0	11	Two of Hubble's four position-stabilizing gyroscopes stopped working when the door opened, but engineers later got them back on line.
0.0568181818181818	11	The gyroscopes were knocked out by the motion and that, too, kept the telescope in the safe mode, said Dave Drachlis, director of orbital verifications at Goddard.
0	11	A colleague, Steve Terry, said Hubble's systems were set at conservative limits for the first operations and that caused many malfunctions.
0	11	There also were two communications outages totaling several hours.
0	11	Hubble is designed with safe modes so it can be the master of its own destiny in case contact with an orbiting communications system is lost for extended periods, Terry said.
0.0727272727272727	11	NASA had planned to release its first test image from the telescope on Tuesday, showing an open star cluster in the constellation Carina.
0.13986013986014	11	But Terry said that would be delayed because of the antenna problems.

0	0	She and several others had staked out the corner table at a restaurant on First Avenue to get a good view of the runners as they romped off the Queensboro Bridge.
0	0	Their hopes on seeing Giannelli depended on how fast the Yonkers native ran.
0	0	We have to leave this table by 12:30.
0	0	The manager's kicking us out, said one of Giannelli's friends, Pete Koogan.
0	0	Torpe was eager for Giannelli to finish, too.

0	1	TOMORROW evening, just before the Olympic closing ceremony, the last and one of the most prestigious events of the Games will be held.
0	1	It is also without doubt the most gruelling.
0	1	Run in high heat, high humidity, high pollution levels and over an extraordinary course, the Barcelona Olympic men's marathon will prove one of the most physically demanding ever run.
0	1	There are lots of figures to show why.
0	1	It is estimated that when the race begins in Mataro, a seaside town north of Barcelona, the temperature will be an already-uncomfortable 25`C. Towards the marathon's end, however, radiant heat thrown off by buildings could be subjecting the runners to a temperature of up to 30`C.
0	1	More debilitating still, relative humidity in Barcelona in August rises as high as 80 per cent.
0	1	With more than 10 kilometres still to go, most of the course is an upward run.
0	1	The last 4.6km, which take the runners 60m higher still to the Olympic stadium at the top of the hill of Montjuic, has an average gradient of more than 4.5 per cent, and includes some sections of 7 per cent, equivalent in skiing terms to a steep run.
0.222222222222222	1	But we do not need figures to convince us of the extraordinary difficulty of tomorrow's race.
0.352941176470588	1	Last Saturday, in the Olympic stadium, I watched the final moments and aftermath of the women's marathon, begun at the same time of day and run in similar conditions.
0	1	Never in any event voluntarily entered into, sporting or otherwise, have I seen such signs of physical and mental distress.
0.105263157894737	1	The race was won by the Unified Team's Valentina Yegorova in 2 hours 32 minutes, a time considerably slower than that achieved by women on less demanding Olympic marathon courses in Los Angeles and Seoul.
0	1	After her nearest competitor, Japan's Yuko Arimori, came in eight seconds later, they had the energy between bouts of grimacing and lowering their heads to their knees to embrace each other and smile for the cameras.
0	1	It was a different story in the zone,' the area under the stadium where athletes recover after their events.
0	1	As runner after runner stumbled and limped into the room several were brought in senseless on stretchers the scene seemed to be populated by exhausted boat people rescued after weeks of exposure and deprivation at sea.
0	1	As a photographer calmly shot off a roll of film a foot from her face, Manuela Machado of Mexico and another runner stood vomiting violently into a potted palm.
0	1	Several competitors lay prone and gasping on the ground as water was poured over them; others stood hunched over, grasping their abdomens.
0	1	If anyone moved at all, it was with agonised faces and the slowest of hobbles.
0	1	These are not the sort of scenes likely to promote enthusiasm for marathon running or for the ideals of Olympic competition.
0.19047619047619	1	Chris Brasher, organiser of the London marathon, was on hand to witness the suffering, and was incensed.
0	1	Male marathon runners will face the same kind of problems with heat, humidity, and an over-demanding terrain, he said.
0.114285714285714	1	In his opinion, gearing the marathon to prime-time TV viewing and having the event end at the top of a hill for the sake of stadium spectators was unjustified and a to commercialism.
0.0851063829787234	1	put on the marathon in the late afternoon, rather than first thing in the morning and then to make them run 4km up a hill is just criminal in my opinion,' said Brasher, a former Olympic gold medal athlete and noted sportswriter.
0.129032258064516	1	I spoke to Britain's Steve Brace, winner of the Paris marathon in 1989 and 1990, the Berlin marathon last year and a competitor in the Barcelona event.
0	1	He agrees that the run will be highly demanding, and while he regards Olympic marathon running as a pinnacle of his career, he is cautious about tomorrow's slog.
0.222222222222222	1	Like almost all the athletes running tomorrow, Brace is a professional runner who specialises in marathons.
0	1	He takes an objective, long-term view of his profession.
0.166666666666667	1	As an income-earner, marathon running is an activity with liabilities and limitations, and requires business management as well as physical ability.
0.571428571428571	1	The winner of the London marathon earns a tidy Dollars 50,000 and the New York, Boston and Japanese runs are all in the same prize-winning category.
0	1	But these and less financially-rewarding events are physically debilitating, and can only be won if a competitor is in top physical shape.
0	1	With their careers and financial prospects in mind, top-level runners normally only run two marathons a year.
0.153846153846154	1	As Brace says, when you have only two pay-days out of 365, you choose, plan and train for them with great care.
0	1	Brace trains extremely carefully indeed.
0.363636363636364	1	a marathon is the easy part,' he says.
0	1	hard part is the lead-up to achieving the performance level required.'
0	1	He starts training three months before an event by running 80 miles a week and then building progressively.
0	1	For the last six weeks he runs 120 miles a week.
0	1	Normally he would hope that such a routine brings a pay-off.
0.444444444444444	1	But the Olympic marathon is an exception: the only top-level marathon that carries no prize money.
0.16	1	Brace says that in spite of the prestige and possible financial spin-offs involved, does not necessarily make sense to run to win.'
0	1	Given the highly demanding nature of the course and their desire to preserve physical condition for races that do bring in money, he says, many runners will give less than their best effort.
0	1	Nonetheless, there are plenty whose considerations stretch beyond the purely financial.
0.210526315789474	1	Italian Gelindo Bordin, who came first in the 1988 Seoul Olympic marathon, is a strong contender.
0	1	So is Djibouti's Ahmed Salah, who came third in Seoul.
0	1	Ibrahim Hussein of Kenya and Hiromi Taniguchi of Japan are also possible winners.
0	1	None of them, though, will make a molehill out of the steep and formidable ascent of Montjuic.
0.125	2	Try to think of Sunday's Los Angeles Marathon less as a which it surely is; or a world-class athletic event, which it may become but is not now.
0	2	Look at it more as a moving advertising opportunity, human billboards running 26.2 miles through the city on live television.
0.272727272727273	2	With that kind of exposure to a potential 12 million Southern Californians, it's no wonder that in only five years the L. A. Marathon has become the best-marketed, slickest, most modern and sponsor-driven of the world's major marathons.
0	2	It may not be an overstatement that the L. A. Marathon is one of the country's best-marketed sports events of any kind.
0	2	Depending on your point of view, this may or may not be good news.
0.457142857142857	2	Massive marketing campaigns and major sponsors lining up for a seat on the money wagon do not make L. A. an elite race, give it prestige or attract the world's best runners.
0	2	However, they do generate a tremendous amount of money for all concerned.
0.0909090909090909	2	And that may yet transform this race, if as marathon President Bill Burke said this week the total purse of $202,520 is increased by $100,000 next year and significantly more money is added for appearance fees to lure top athletes.
0	2	The lineup of commercial support is impressive.
0	2	The race has Mercedes-Benz of North America as its presenting sponsor, making it one of 10 companies that have not only paid the race organizers to be called sponsors, but have also put more money into the race either outright or by providing products and services.
0	2	Mercedes provides automobiles for the top male and female finishers.
0	2	The Times is one of the race's more generous sponsors.
0	2	According to Will Kern, director of Times special events, this year's marathon has received almost $500,000 worth of donated advertising space.
0	2	For this, the newspaper has received more than $50,000 in contributions to the Times Fund charity, Kern said.
0	2	In addition, the marathon sells its name to licensees and suppliers, who donate everything from fruit and water to the official salted snack and the official hair-growth product.
0	2	The race's marketing-oriented philosophy can be traced to Burke and marathon Vice President Marie Patrick.
0	2	was because of our backgrounds in business," said Patrick, who came to the marathon from sports marketing in tennis.
0	2	not runners, never have been.
0	2	We knew that you have to have big dollars in the beginning.
0	2	From there you can move forward to be a major event."
0	2	Burke and Patrick have formed a persuasive and successful recruiting team.
0	2	According to Mary Reiling, national event manager for AT&amp;T, the L.A. Marathon's approach is a big incentive.
0	2	worked a lot of events with a lot of different promoters, but they are by far the most creative group I've ever seen," she said.
0.551724137931034	2	Mercedes-Benz, which also sponsors marathons in New York and San Francisco, likes the fact that the race gives them a foothold in their No. 1 market.
0	2	whole marketing approach of Bill Burke is great for sponsors," said Linda Paulmeno, manager of press relations for Mercedes-Benz.
0	2	whole race is very marketing-oriented."
0	2	The race depends on sponsors for the bulk of its operating budget, which supports a year-round full-time staff.
0	2	Patrick said the cost to sponsors varies from mid-six-figure range to over $1 million."
0	2	The fees depend on the services and products offered by a firm.
0	2	Trade-outs are common.
0	2	The marathon receives several hundred thousand dollars from KCOP for the television rights, and the race has also been sold to cable and will be covered by radio.
0	2	The sponsors also work together for mutual benefit.
0	2	For example, AT&amp;T is buying commercial time on Channel 13's broadcast, and Channel 13 is providing updates on the AT&amp;T Friendship Cup, an international race within the race.
0	2	In fact, television makes the race more attractive to sponsors, who figure to multiply their exposure.
0	2	Richard Lipeles, president of PacifiCare Health Systems, said sponsorship in the race helps separate his company in a congested health-care market.
0.4	2	Also, the company provides headbands to all runners.
0.222222222222222	2	we'd love it if every runner wore our headband during the race," he said.
0	3	Their common ground pretty much ended when the miles of asphalt to the finish line did.
0.08	3	By the time most people were starting their first cup of coffee Sunday morning, Benjamin Paredez Martinez of Ecatepec, Mexico, and Kathy Smith of Newport Beach were crowned winners in the San Diego Marathon at the Oceanside pier, efforts than earned them $2,000 apiece.
0	3	The runs set records on the new North County course, but the times, even helped by warm breezes and clear, 74-degree conditions, were hardly blistering.
0	3	Martinez, 29, finished in 2 hours 19 minutes 3 seconds, 36 seconds faster than Doug Kurtis of Northville, Mich.
0	3	Smith's 2:43:05 seemed days quicker than the 2:52:12 posted by Escondido's Mindy Ireland.
0	3	In years past, the marathon's mystery often has been who the leader was, not how he got there.
0	3	Runners, often from Mexico, would register late, and race officials were at their wits end when the media screamed to know the identity of the leader.
0	3	This year, officials made sure there were no mystery men out on the course.
0	3	They knew who Martinez was, but no one was sure how he was able to practically appear out of nowhere to take the lead from Alfredo Rosas of San Pedro going into the 25-mile mark.
0	3	What Martinez did, was start out slow and deliberate.
0	3	Through an interpreter, Martinez said he started out running 5:15 or 5:20 miles.
0	3	Rosas and a pack of as many as eight came out at a pace seven to 10 seconds quicker per mile.
0	3	knew it would kill them, that they would never keep it up," said Martinez, who won with a 5:18-mile pace.
0	3	had to have patience and run from the back."
0	3	After the 14-mile mark, the pack has already thinned to just Rosas, Danny Bustos, Doug Kurtis and Ernesto Gutierrez, who ran single file for a time.
0	3	Martinez and Martin Rodriguez Rivera held back, but Martinez soon heard a little voice that told him to move or be removed from contention.
0	3	first 10-15 miles, I could have been in 1,000th place," Martinez said.
0	3	Then I got worried."
0	3	Martinez left Rivera, and started on the chase.
0.125	3	Since Martinez hadn't been seen earlier, it originally was thought the figure gainly ground slowly but methodically from Mile 21 to Mile 24 was San Diego's Henry Chio.
0	3	Martinez' late kick caught Rosas, who had broken away on his own for a three-mile lead at Mile 21, cramped and been surprised at the 23-mile mark.
0	3	tied up, there was nothing I could do," said Rosas, who was third in 2:19.49.
0	3	he started closing, that's when my legs really started getting sore.
0	3	I tried to just hang on, to hang in there, but he shot ahead of me."
0	3	Before Martinez took the lead for good a uphill surge at Mile 25 it appeared Rosas was hearing footsteps and was looking over his shoulder to see who was gaining on him.
0	3	Not so, said Rosas.
0	3	police on the bikes were telling me how close he was," he said.
0.2	3	It was the second marathon in two weeks that Kurtis, 38, has run, and almost won.
0	3	The Bangkok Marathon in November was his 13th of the year, his 112th to date.
0	3	The only recurring theme in Martinez' and Smith's backgrounds other than the 26.2 miles they ran was that they are novices at long-distance running, this was their first victory at this distance and that they are both teachers.
0	3	Martinez is a world-class biathlete who finished third at the World Duathlon Championship two weeks ago near Palm Springs.
0.444444444444444	3	He has run only two marathons before Sunday.
0	3	He teaches physical education in his hometown, 10-15 miles outside of Mexico City.
0	3	Smith, 24, was a 5,000- and 10,000-meter specialist at Stanford but is now focusing on longer distances.
0	3	She is a fourth- through sixth-grade teacher at College Park in Irvine.
0	3	She was holding class with reporters long before Ireland, 39, was carried into a room for mandatory drug testing the United States Olympic Committee Drug Testing Program randomly selected this race to administer tests to the top finishers.
0	3	goal was to come out here, be as low-key as possible and try to qualify for the trials," said Smith, who finished fourth last year and ran a personal-best time Sunday.
0	3	She met and beat the Olympic Trials qualifying standard of 2:45.
0	3	Smith said she and Ireland ran together they even chatted through the 20-mile mark, until Smith got her feet working faster than her mouth.
0.181818181818182	3	Having run with Ireland last year in the San Diego Marathon, Smith knew a little of Ireland's racing style.
0.285714285714286	3	really tough in the latter part of a race," Smith said.
0	3	wanted to hang back with her, so then she could carry me through the latter part.
0	3	She hung in pretty well with me."
0.153846153846154	3	Smith earlier this year ran the Long Beach Marathon, where she finished seventh but has been concentrating on this distance for just a year.
0	3	She is getting smarter about it.
0	3	year I led from Miles 13 to 22," Smith said.
0	3	year's it's just a matter of maturity.
0	3	And the hills were positive for me."
0	3	Martinez said entered this event because he knew the field was weak and his chances were good.
0	3	knew Rosas and Kurtis were good, but it was a relatively weak field," he said.
0	3	But weak field or not, the 4,000-plus runners who participated in the event seemed to relish the experience, as all the problems the marathon has had to deal with faded as each runner crossed the finish line.
0.2	3	a beautiful course, and this was a great marathon," one runner told race director Lynn Flanagan.
0	3	can't believe it went off so well," said another to a volunteer.
0	3	never know anything had happened that was at all an inconvenience."
0	3	DeAnna Sodoma of Escondido won her first marathon wheelchair race in 2:17:52; Saul Mendoza Hernandez of Mexico won the men's division in 1:57:50.
0.32	3	James Sheremeta of San Diego won the men's half marathon in 1:08:59; Jeanne Lassee-Johnson was the women's half winner in 1:16:15.
0	4	Suicide or sense?
0	4	The answer may decide the men's winner of Monday's Boston Marathon.
0	4	For the women, the story line is more personal.
0	4	Can Ingrid Kristiansen and Joan Benoit Samuelson, the two fastest women's marathoners in history, return to their past glory after having their second babies or is a wave of runners ready to sweep past them?
0	4	And for the sentimentalists, there will be 83-year-old Johnny Kelley starting in his 60th Boston Marathon.
0	4	There have only been 35 editions of this race run without him.
0.333333333333333	4	The last three Boston marathons have turned into reckless speed duels.
0.181818181818182	4	They have produced five of the top 10 times and eight of the top 15 in the race's storied history.
0	4	They also have resulted in a race of attrition, with many of the early speedsters burning out completely or faltering in the late stages.
0	4	Along the historic route that begins in Hopkinton, west of Boston, and ends in Copley Square in the Back Bay section of the city, checkpoint records have fallen at an alarming rate.
0	4	For example, all 11 checkpoint records were shattered through the first 20 miles last year, either by Simon Robert Naali or Juma Ikangaa, both of Tanzania.
0	4	The winner was 1988 Olympic champion Gelindo Bordin, who outsmarted the early pacesetters by running a patient, calculating race.
0.0740740740740741	4	Running alone about 200 meters behind a pack of six Africans, Bordin passed them all by 21 miles and went on to win in 2 hours, 8 minutes, 19 seconds, the second-fastest time in the race's history, behind only the 2:07:51 by Rob de Castella in 1986.
0	4	Ikangaa finished a distant second in 2:09:52.
0	4	It was his third consecutive runner-up finish in Boston.
0	4	Ikangaa is back again, along with several other formidable Africans.
0.166666666666667	4	They include Ibrahim Hussein of Kenya, the 1988 winner in 2:08:43, the third-fastest time in Boston and one second ahead of Ikangaa
0.266666666666667	4	Abebe Mekonnen of Ethiopia, the 1989 champion in 2:09:06, Boston's eighth-best time
0	4	Douglas Wakiihuri of Kenya, the 1987 world champion and 1988 Olympic silver medalist who is making his Boston debut
0	4	and Naali, the third-place finisher in the 1990 Commonwealth Games.
0	4	Among those chasing them will be John Treacy, the 1984 Olympic silver medalist and the third-place finisher in Boston in 1988 and 1989
0.5	4	Geoff Smith, the Boston winner in 1984-85
0	4	Ed Eyestone, the top-ranked U.S. marathoner
0.266666666666667	4	Salvador Garcia, the runner-up to Wakiihuri in last year's New York City Marathon
0	4	and Rolando Vera, who finished third in his marathon debut in Boston in 1990.
0	4	The women's division also is filled with many respectable entrants.
0.166666666666667	4	Foremost among them are Kristiansen, the 35-year-old Norwegian who holds the world record of 2:21:06 and won in Boston in 1986 and 1989, and Samuelson, 33, the U.S.-record holder at 2:21:21, 1984 Olympic gold medalist and Boston champion in 1979 and 1983.
0	4	Challenging them will be Uta Pippig, Wanda Panfil and Kim Jones.
0	4	Pippig finished second in Boston last year in a career-best 2:28:03.
0.181818181818182	4	Panfil won the London Marathon in 2:26:31, her personal best, and won the New York City Marathon in 1990.
0.222222222222222	5	The women's field for Sunday's San Francisco Marathon appears mighty impressive to race President Rich Nichols, who didn't have to do much coaxing to get the highly ranked women to enter.
0	5	year's women's field is interesting because most of the competitors called us," said Nichols.
0	5	didn't have to do the calling like we normally would have to."
0	5	The Olympic trials, scheduled for January, have made Nichols' job much easier this year.
0.695652173913043	5	Most top-ranked U.S. women are looking for any summer-time marathon in which to run and the San Francisco version offers excellent conditions.
0.4	5	The hills of San Francisco make this marathon challenging.
0	5	The weather, however, makes it one of the few enticing races held from June to September.
0	5	Early morning temperatures range in the low 50s in late June.
0.347826086956522	5	is the only place in the world where you can have a marathon in the middle of summer," Nichols said.
0	5	Defending champ back
0.266666666666667	5	Last year's winner, Janis Klecker of Minnetonka, Minn., is entered.
0	5	The field also boasts Janine Aiello of Albuquerque, N.M.
0	5	Michelle Bush-Cuke of Berrien Springs, Mich.
0	5	Christine Gibbons of Elmwood, N.J.
0	5	Lesley Lahane of Chestnut Hills, Mass.
0	5	Julie Shea-Graw of Raleigh, N.C., and Jane Welzel of Fort Collins, Colo.
0	5	All seven women have run marathons under the 2-hour, 40-minute barrier.
0	5	Klecker turned in a 2:39:52 on the 26.2-mile course.
0.266666666666667	5	Welzel is the 1990 national champion, Gibbons has won 26 marathons, Lahane is a former cross-country national champion and Aiello twice has finished second in San Francisco.
0	5	A test for Shea-Graw
0.142857142857143	5	Shea-Graw, 32, finished third in the 1981 New York City Marathon and was consistently ranked among the top five American runners throughout most of the early
0	5	She was the top qualifier for the 1980 Olympics team that missed the Moscow Summer Games because of a U.S. boycott.
0	5	This will be Shea-Graw's first race outside of North Carolina since 1986, when she took time off to have a child.
0.444444444444444	5	run some local races," Shea-Graw said.
0	5	is going to be a test for me.
0	5	If it goes well, then I'll up the ante and give my training the time that is needed to become competitive again."
0	5	Shea-Graw's best time is 2:30:11.
0	5	had some major injuries and wanted to have a child," Shea-Graw said.
0	5	now it's time to get on with my career."
0	6	TO MOST PEOPLE, marathons and vacations are mutually exclusive.
0	6	Vacation, according to Webster, means from any activity
0.5	6	A marathon, says the same source, is footrace of 26 miles, 385 yards, run over an open course."
0	6	But a unique subset has formed: people who like to do both at the same time.
0	6	And to help these folks along, companies arrange tours for marathon vacations.
0	6	Bangkok in November, London in April and Stockholm in May.
0	6	have mountain ranges, tennis players have resorts, why can't a runner take a marathon vacation?"
0	6	said Thorn Gilligan, president of Marathon Tours in Boston.
0	6	runner should be able to enjoy a closed city for a day.
0.285714285714286	6	It's a celebration for the sport as much as a competition."
0	6	Gilligan took 5,500 people last year on 20 tours to countries from Bermuda to Moscow.
0	6	In addition to air fare and hotel, runners are guaranteed spots in restricted entry races such as the London Marathon.
0	6	Qualifying times are not required.
0.75	6	London, the most popular European city to visit, holds the world's largest marathon
0.333333333333333	6	Berlin's race has grown with the demise of the wall.
0.363636363636364	6	marathons take you through cities, so you get a chance to see things you'd never see on a sightseeing bus," said Fred Lebow, president of the New York Roadrunner's Club and director of the New York Marathon.
0.363636363636364	6	Lebow has run in 32 marathons, including London, Paris, Rome, Stockholm, Iceland, Seoul and Vienna.
0.285714285714286	6	most exciting thing is the start of the race," he said.
0	6	city has something unique."
0.129032258064516	6	The cities are different, but most marathons include a carbo-loading pasta party the night before, medical exams, a post-race celebration, commemorative T-shirts and awards to finishers.
0	6	Entry fees vary
0	6	Brussels is $16, Venice $40.
0	6	Marathon Tours includes the entry price in the package.
0.266666666666667	6	Going to Bermuda, for example, costs approximately $900 from San Francisco.
0	6	The price includes round-trip air fare, four days and three nights at the Grotto Bay Beach hotel full breakfasts and dinners, a welcome cocktail party and post-race parties and discounts.
0	6	England has similar organizations: Sports Tours International and Keith Prowse, a company that specializes in British theater, sports and concert tours.
0.166666666666667	6	But it isn't necessary to run 26.2 miles to go on a running vacation, especially if it's a family trip.
0.347826086956522	6	Some marathons, like Portland's, include additional races: a five-mile run, a five-mile walk and a kids run.
0	6	Tel Aviv has a half-marathon and a fun run.
0	6	Budapest offers a half-marathon and a mini-marathon along the Danube.
0	6	There are also trips that incorporate running into the sightseeing schedule.
0	6	Running coach Pat Savage and Hal Higdon, a senior writer for Runner's World, are taking a group to Ireland in June.
0	6	The eight-day trip will leave from Chicago and will include sightseeing, guided runs and a fun run from Malahide Castle to Swords.
0	6	a running vacation you plan something around running everyday," Higdon said.
0	6	know the unique scenic routes and put together special runs."
0	6	Some runs are intriguing because of current events.
0	6	The Tel Aviv Marathon course went past houses hit by Scud missiles during the Gulf War.
0	6	The Belgrade Marathon was held despite Yugoslavia's turmoil.
0	6	The Munich course is the same as the 1972 Olympic route and finishes in the same stadium.
0.125	6	Running 26 miles just to see a city definitely isn't for everyone, but at the very least, it's a way to kill two birds with one stone.
0	6	In the recent Chicago Marathon, a German man ran with a camera, snapping photos every few miles.
0	6	IF YOU'RE INTERESTED

0	7	And cheering every step of that distance will be more than a dozen corporate sponsors and licensees.
0.16	7	Makers of cars, soda pop, sportswear, copiers, computers even a hospital have tagged their names to the Los Angeles Marathon.
0	7	In the promoter's words, this run is marketing event on legs," reflecting marathoning's growing importance in upscale product promotions.
0	7	Runners, it seems, are a well-heeled lot.
0	7	A study by Mercedes-Benz found that 42% of family heads making $40,000 a year or more jog regularly.
0	7	Of potential buyers showing up at Mercedes dealers, 47% are joggers.
0.774193548387097	7	With those numbers in mind, the car maker has become a sponsor of three marathons in New York, Boston and Los Angeles as well as other running races.
0	7	Marathons have had corporate backing for some time.
0.25	7	But Los Angeles is ahead of the pack in making distance running a commercial spectacle.
0.0888888888888889	7	The city that invented the corporate-sponsored Olympics has created a marathon unlike others artfully dressed as an Olympic-type amateur race, but built from the ground up to make money for the closely held company that controls it as well as for the city.
0.181818181818182	7	took air and made an event," says William Burke, the founder and president of Los Angeles Marathon Inc.
0.142857142857143	7	For a man whose running days ended with his high school track team, Mr. Burke is turning a lot of heads in the world of marathoning.
0.121212121212121	7	Last year, its first time out, the Los Angeles race attracted nearly 11,000 runners four times the number forecast and enough to make it the third largest race in the U.S.
0	7	The event also pulled in about $4 million in cash and services from its sponsors, leaving the organizers with $370,000 in red ink.
0	7	This year, Mr. Burke and his partner, Marie Patrick, expect to gross about $5 million in cash and services and to break even.
0	7	Next year, they say, a profit is possible.
0	7	More than 18,000 runners are expected this year.
0.114285714285714	7	An audience of perhaps a million and a half or more will line the route, drawn in part by advertisements on 75 million Coca-Cola cans and 2,500 billboards around the Los Angeles area.
0	7	Marketing experts say the festive atmosphere of big crowds in the streets makes marathons attractive to sponsors.
0	7	For the cost of a 30-second ad on the Super Bowl, a company can sponsor a marathon and over a city," says Lesa Ukman, editor of Special Events Reports, a Chicago-based newsletter.
0.210526315789474	7	The Los Angeles organizers and sponsors have perhaps done more than their counterparts elsewhere to publicize the event.
0	7	Los Angelenos are seeing plugs for the race on millions of grocery bags, milk cartons and loaves of bread, in addition to soda cans, billboards and other sources.
0.444444444444444	7	The venerable New York Marathon is taking note.
0.285714285714286	7	The New York Road Runners Club, organizer of the race, stopped promoting the event some years ago because it had all the runners it wanted.
0.153846153846154	7	Now, Fred Lebow, the group's president, says he is encouraging sponsors to promote the race as the Los Angeles sponsors do.
0.5	7	The promotion in Los Angeles is unabashed.
0.148148148148148	7	tell people that if they're looking for a new way to crack the Los Angeles market, this is it," says Mr. Burke.
0.307692307692308	7	The pitch has attracted the likes of Coca-Cola Bottling Co. of Los Angeles
0	7	Vons Cos., a large supermarket chain
1	7	the Los Angeles Times
0	7	the Sears Savings Bank unit of Sears, Roebuck Co.
0	7	Eastman Kodak Co., and Tandem Computers Inc.
0	7	One supporter is Ellesse USA, a sportswear and shoe producer.
0	7	A $50,000 fee enables the company to use the marathon's name in its ads
0	7	Ellesse will spend an additional $100,000 dressing race personnel in T-shirts and warm-up suits, showing its clothes at the marathon's public of sponsors' wares, and posting a dozen big street banners along the course.
0	7	The company has rented more than 500 billboards at a cut-rate price of $120,000 from Patrick Media Group, a marathon sponsor.
0	7	The discount, about 50%, was important.
0	7	couldn't have bought that kind of exposure normally," says Susan Cialone, Ellesse's advertising director.
0.222222222222222	7	Ellesse, which also sponsors the New York run, finds the West Coast event more freewheeling.
0	7	have let us do whatever we want," says Ms. Cialone.
0.363636363636364	7	For instance, product banners along the route almost impossible to arrange in New York are a snap in Los Angeles.
0	7	The city, in fact, is a partner in the race.
0.2	7	After competitive bidding, it awarded an eight-year contract to Los Angeles Marathon Inc. to put on the race.
0	7	The exclusive franchise calls for the race organizers this year to pay a minimum $60,000 fee or 4% of gross cash receipts to the city.
0.210526315789474	7	The organizers also will pay the cost of city services for the marathon, estimated at $100,000.
0.153846153846154	7	The race sponsors and city officials are trading freely on the good will generated by Los Angeles's role as host of the 1984 Olympics.
0.333333333333333	7	The logo of the marathon is a shield with laurel wreath.
0.266666666666667	7	Some posters show the Los Angeles Coliseum with its torch and giant Olympic symbol.
0.333333333333333	7	World Returns to Los Angeles," proclaims one Mercedes-Benz ad.
0	7	Race directors are called a term borrowed from the 1984 Olympic organization, in which Mr. Burke was commissioner of tennis.
0.181818181818182	7	And like the Olympics, Los Angeles Marathon Inc., portraying the race as a civic celebration, thrives on volunteers.
0	7	Some 7,500 people will work for free to monitor the course on race day.
0	7	And two-thirds of the race's office staff work without pay.
0	7	couldn't buy this," Mr. Burke says, gesturing around the crowded race headquarters.
0	7	Not everyone works for free.
0	7	Big-name runners, for instance, want to be paid a lot.
0	7	And here, the organizers have pinched pennies.
0.117647058823529	7	While some runners will be paid to appear, this year's field, like last year's, lacks some of the superstars who race in Boston, New York and London.
0.444444444444444	7	Grete Waitz, one of the best woman marathoners, wanted $100,000 to appear in Los Angeles
0	7	she was turned down.
0.181818181818182	7	Mr. Burke says the Australian runner Rob de Castella made it known through his agent that he wouldn't run any marathons in the spring but, for $25,000, he'd be happy to say the Los Angeles event was tempting.
0	7	Mr. Burke says he slammed down the phone.
0	7	won't spend extraordinary amounts of money on any single runner to the detriment of the other runners," he says.
0	7	Mr. de Castella's agent denies the story entirely.
0.5	7	What Los Angeles lacks in superstars, it plans to make up for in numbers.
0.705882352941177	7	This year's race may challenge New York and London as the largest marathon ever run.
0.4	7	Some 20,500 started the New York race last year.
0.363636363636364	7	Mr. Lebow, organizer of the New York event, says next year's Los Angeles Marathon will surpass that number.
0	7	For one sponsor, this may be a mixed blessing.
0	7	Orthopaedic Hospital, a not-for-profit institution whose sponsorship is part of a publicity campaign, provides emergency care stations along the marathon route.
0	7	Last year, one of every 20 runners needed aid.
0	7	Along with sprains, strains and blisters came more serious cases of exhaustion and hypothermia.
0	7	A spokeswoman says: advised 250 people to quit the race."
0	8	EAST DENNIS, Mass. It's 5:30 a.m., an icy rain is falling from an indigo sky, and there's a stiff northeaster.
0.235294117647059	8	This Cape Cod country road is deserted, but for the sweaty silhouette of John Kelley.
0	8	Bounding up a hill in his thin green Windbreaker, with sand from the beach blowing into his face, Mr. Kelley shouts over the howling gale: isn't too bad, you know," he says, though the wind chill factor is about 20 below.
0.285714285714286	8	Mr. Kelley is in training for the Boston Marathon his 60th Boston Marathon.
0.129032258064516	8	And even at the age of 83, he probably will finish ahead of a large number of the 13,000 runners expected to compete officially or unofficially on April 15.
0.235294117647059	8	Bill Rodgers, a four-time Boston Marathon winner who plans to run again this year, marvels at Mr. Kelley: incomprehensible that a man his age is doing what he's doing.
0	8	I'm struggling at the age of 43. This isn't golf."
0.833333333333333	8	Even the thought of running a course of 26 miles and 385 yards leaves some of Mr. Kelley's rivals of yesteryear gasping.
0	8	is more like it," says Leslie Pawson, 86, a three-time Boston champion who ran against Mr. Kelley half a century ago.
0	8	doctor says: running, whatsoever.'
0.307692307692308	8	I can't even remember when I ran my last marathon."
0	8	John Adelbert Kelley is a throwback to a time when marathoners did it for glory and cab fare.
0.129032258064516	8	A two-time winner in Boston and runner-up seven times, Mr. Kelley is to be the oldest competitor in the race this year as he has been for 15 years.
0	8	Mr. Kelley is such an institution that Hopkinton, Mass., where the race begins, has made him an honorary citizen.
0	8	Two state troopers will run alongside the 5-foot-6, 130-pound Mr. Kelley into Boston so he won't be trampled by as he calls them, clamoring to shake his hand.
0	8	Last year, five Japanese runners were waved away by the bodyguards, as they sidled up to the old celebrity during the race.
0	8	Recalls Suni Tomomitsu, one of the runners: first we thought, wow, he's like Mafia man.'
0	8	Then we said, no, this is nice Johnny Kelley.'
0	8	In Japan, he is awesome."
0.347826086956522	8	Though he isn't the oldest person ever to enter the Boston Marathon, Mr. Kelley is the oldest to run it.
0	8	Peter Foley, who was born in 1859, was a regular until he was well into his 80s.
0	8	But he walked the course.
0	8	Starting at dawn Mr. Foley would eventually saunter across the finish line in the moonlight.
0.347826086956522	8	Of course, Mr. Kelley not to be confused with the other John Kelley, who won the Boston Marathon in 1957 isn't the runner he was in 1935 when he won the race, in 2 hours, 32 minutes, 7 seconds.
0	8	His best time ever was in 1945: 2 hours, 30 minutes, 40 seconds.
0	8	Last year he finished in 5 hours, 5 minutes.
0	8	He hopes to do better in 1991.
0	8	not a prediction, just a goal," he says.
0.108108108108108	8	When John Kelley first toed the line in 1928, George Bush wasn't yet in kindergarten, Joe DiMaggio was an unknown and Nike was the winged goddess of victory, not a running shoe.
0.148148148148148	8	In those days, Mr. Kelley recalls, he ran in black leather high-jumping shoes that he cut open at the toes with a razor blade.
0.2	8	would have loved to run with the worst pair of sneakers on the market today," he says.
0.307692307692308	8	Back then, the sport didn't have much of a following.
0.275862068965517	8	Today, of course, the Boston Marathon is a big deal, covered by TV from start to finish and offering $402,000 altogether in prize money.
0	8	winners get a medal and $55,000," says Mr. Kelley.
0	8	got a medal and beef stew.
0	8	God bless them," he adds.
0	8	The rosy-cheeked, supple Mr. Kelley is a medical wonder.
0	8	Each year, he visits the Cooper Clinic at the Aerobics Center in Dallas for a battery of endurance tests.
0	8	whatever that means, I got all A's," Mr. Kelley reports of his checkup four months ago.
0	8	that means," explains Kenneth Cooper, the physician who wrote and several sequels and is now at work on a book on elderly athletes, that Johnny has the body of a man 23 years younger.
0	8	He's going to be one of the stars of my book."
0	8	Mr. Kelley's resting pulse rate 60 beats a minute is well below the average person's 72 beats.
0	8	On the stress test the clinic gives, Mr. Kelley holds the endurance record for his age group.
0.148148148148148	8	A mechanic for Boston Edison Co. before he retired in 1972, Mr. Kelley started running in the evenings after work more than six decades ago.
0	8	His only purpose was to relax and have some fun.
0	8	day long, I did what my boss told me to do," he recalls.
0	8	when I ran at night, I felt free.
0	8	I ran till I was exhausted."
0	8	In 1928, when he was 21, he entered his first Boston Marathon but didn't finish.
0	8	He dropped out three-quarters of the way through the race.
0.25	8	Then, in 1933, he finished 37th in a field of about 200 runners.
0	8	In all the years since, he has missed the race just once, in 1967.
0.235294117647059	8	has competed, all told, in 112 marathons, including the 1936 and 1948 Olympics.
0.0952380952380952	8	Mr. Kelley well knows the jagged course from Hopkinton to downtown Boston: The first challenge comes five miles into the race, where a set of little hills can get a psyched runner to waste energy charging up the slopes.
0.153846153846154	8	A mile and a half later, there's new reason to beware: The smells of Cavanaugh's Bakery can set off hunger pangs.
0	8	An Exxon station in Wellesley marks the halfway point.
0	8	A steep descent into Newton Lower Falls can jar a tired runner's bones.
0	8	Then, at the end of a long column of oak and maple trees, is Heartbreak Hill, his nemesis.
0	8	It cost him at least two victories, he says.
0	8	And finally there's the Haunted Mile, a stretch where many runners have collapsed.
0	8	Boston's skyline, 2 1/2 miles in the distance, can seem so far away.
0	8	Though still going strong, Mr. Kelley acknowledges the marathon gets tougher each year.
0	8	To compensate, he trains harder.
0	8	He used to start preparing in earnest at the end of January.
0	8	recent years, I've been in training 12 months a year," he says, though the serious stuff a daily one-hour run, sprints on the track and long, 2 1/2-hour runs every other week begins in December.
0	8	Mr. Kelley always trains at 5 a.m., and alone: a quiet time, no traffic; the air is fresh and sweet."
0	8	His routes vary.
0	8	In January, he prefers the frozen sands of the beach.
0	8	With the approach of spring, he takes to the alder and scrub-pine hills and bluffs where the sun can be seen rising over Cape Cod Bay.
0	8	After his morning run, he spends a couple of hours painting a hobby he took up about 25 years ago.
0.210526315789474	8	Unlike many runners, Mr. Kelley doesn't bother with stretching exercises before he runs in the morning.
0	8	is my warm up: I empty the dishwasher, I set up the coffeepot, but I don't plug it in.
0	8	I set up the breakfast table.
0	8	Then I check the outside temperature to see what clothes to wear."
0	8	He and his wife, Laura, live in a two-bedroom ranch-style house here in East Dennis, with more than 350 trophies, medals and sweat-stained marathon numbers scattered about.
0	8	He isn't particular about brands of shoes or what he eats
0.285714285714286	8	Mr. Kelley aims to run till he is at least 100 years old.
0.235294117647059	8	a strange man," says Laura Kelley, in awe of her husband's vigor.
0	8	The 82-year-old Mrs. Kelley adds, just try to stay in his shadow, but I have a hard time even doing that."
0	8	In a rare moment of reflection, Mr. Kelley explains what makes him tick: paint because I like it.
0	8	I run because I like it.
0.2	8	If for some reason I don't finish the marathon, I don't owe an apology to anyone.
0.19047619047619	8	But I'll tell you, the Boston Marathon with all those people waving is better than my birthday."

0.04	0	John Lennon spent much of a three-year span tucked away in his room, sleeping or sitting in a lotus position with his head enveloped in tobacco or marijuana smoke, according to a biography of the slain Beatle.
0.290909090909091	0	An excerpt from the book, The Lives of John Lennon by journalist and biographer Albert Goldman, appearing in the Aug. 15 issue of People magazine, discloses a sometimes unflattering portrait of both Lennon and his second wife, Yoko Ono.
0.106666666666667	0	The book is scheduled to be published later this month by William Morrow Co.
0	0	Between 1976 and 1979, Goldman writes, Lennon could not be more remote.
0.05	0	Apart from a few hours in the morning and evening, including time spent with his son, Sean, Lennon is back here in his room, alone and silent.
0.064	0	The author says the idolized Beatle spent most of his adult life as an anorexic, starving himself to what he perceived as perfection.
0	0	The onset of the eating disorder can be traced to 1965, Goldman writes, when some fool described him in print as the Beatle.'
0	0	That phrase struck such a blow to his fragile ego that the wound has never healed.
0.139130434782609	0	Lennon rarely wore clothing, other than a pair of backless slippers, and avoided touching anyone, according to the book.
0.106666666666667	0	The 719-page biography also details Yoko Ono's $5,000-a-week heroin habit in 1979.

0.213333333333333	0	I must have taken a thousand trips, the book quotes Lennon as saying.
0	0	I just ate it all the time like candy.
0.106666666666667	0	Goldman spent more than six years researching the book, interviewing 1,200 friends, relatives and associates of Lennon, who was murdered eight years ago in New York.
0.594285714285714	1	A biography that portrays John Lennon as a drug-addled, anorexic bisexual who raged his way from Liverpool to New York City is totally fiction, Yoko Ono said in a national radio broadcast.
0	1	It's amazing that somebody took such a poetic license.
0.0421052631578947	1	I don't see John in there It's a very dramatically described something, but it's not about John, Ono said Wednesday night in her first broadcast comments on the book by Albert Goldman.
0.182857142857143	1	The usually reclusive Ono agreed to the interview to counter Goldman's The Lives of John Lennon, which presents the ex-Beatle as a violent, drug-addicted drunk who wanted to dump his wife.
0.218181818181818	1	As for Ono, Goldman shows her as a gold-digger who snorted heroin up to the time of Lennon's death.
0.0484848484848485	1	Goldman also charges she was responsible for Paul McCartney's 1980 marijuana bust in Japan, had affairs while they were married and was just as intent on a divorce as Lennon.
0	1	Ono refuted virtually all of these charges, and countered through taped interviews with Lennon friends and employees that Goldman's book was based on unreliable sources and misquotes.
0.141176470588235	1	It's totally fiction, Yoko said during the hour-long program, which opened with Lennon's song, Gimme Some Truth, and coincided with the book's national release Wednesday.
0.177777777777778	1	These people in this book are not us.
0	1	It's not John and me, Ono continued.
0	1	It's unfair he's been assaulted and can't hit back.
0	1	For some reason this book is attempting to rob both John and I of the basic human dignity that we're entitled to.
0	1	The Ono interview was taped Aug. 28 at the Dakota, where the Lennons lived and Yoko still lives with their son, Sean.
0.1	1	Lennon was murdered by Mark David Chapman outside the Dakota on Dec. 8, 1980.
0.0533333333333333	1	The interview was broadcast nationwide via the Westwood One Network; spokeswoman Laurie Wilde said an exact figure on how many stations picked up the broadcast was not available.
0	1	Also appearing were Sean and Lennon other son, Julian.
0	1	Ono was interviewed by longtime associate Elliot Mintz, who is described in Goldman's book as a spy for Yoko a charge Mintz denied during the show.
0.0390243902439024	1	It is, for one, very upsetting, but most of all it is lies, untruths The whole thing is just sickening, said Julian, who also refuted Goldman's tales of Lennon as a violent father.
0.0842105263157895	1	Mintz read excerpts from the book to Yoko, who then responded to the allegations point by point.
0.0470588235294118	1	She denied that Lennon was homosexual; that he was using drugs while living at the Dakota with his son, Sean; that he had become a reclusive rock roll Howard Hughes.
0	1	She did acknowledge having a heroin problem during the late 1970s, but rejected Goldman's assertion that she had a $5,000-a-week habit.
0.12972972972973	1	The book has already drawn angry responses from friends of Lennon and Ono McCartney, who contradicted one anecdote involving Lennon smashing a painting in Paul's home, has urged a boycott of the book.
0.0551724137931034	1	After Yoko's rebuttal, listeners were invited to dial 900-digit telephone numbers to vote on whether the book was an accurate portrayal of the Lennons' life.
0	1	Results were not expected until later today.
0	1	Goldman, who conducted more than 1,200 interviews for his Lennon book, has written controversial biographies of comedian Lenny Bruce and Elvis Presley.
0.309677419354839	2	When celebrity biographer Albert Goldman began digging into The Lives of John Lennon, his first move was to mail a long, reverential request for help to Yoko Ono.
0	2	She was Numero Uno, you've got to start with her.
0	2	I sent her a sincere letter, because at that time I was a true believer in rock's greatest love story.
0	2	I told her, in your corner,' Goldman recalled.
0	2	Ono never responded.
0	2	And after 1,200 interviews and 6{ years, the dream was over for Goldman, his mythic view of Lennon the Great altered.
0	2	Expecting the best, Goldman claims to have uncovered the worst: a volatile, debauched Lennon who evolved into the Howard Hughes of rock roll, tucked in his Dakota bed for days at a time.
0.0888888888888889	2	That vision of the ex-Beatle has infuriated Lennon supporters, family and friends and prompted charges of fiction writing; it also taught Goldman who says he is a John Lennon fan a hard lesson.
0	2	It doesn't pay to meet your idols.
0	2	Just enjoy them; don't try to see the reality, Goldman said.
0	2	My books are a cold dose of reality.
0	2	You get in the Beatle shower, and suddenly the water goes cold.
0.0421052631578947	2	Goldman, whose past tell-all biographies dealt with Elvis Presley and Lenny Bruce, remains unmoved by the hue and cry from the music industry, from Ono and from Lennon's Beatle buddy, Paul McCartney.
0	2	My books are bad for business, Goldman said in a phone interview from Munich, West Germany.
0	2	They're bad for Paul's business, bad for Yoko's business, back for the jive myth of rock business.
0	2	Those people have to hate me.
0	2	Myth-shattering is a not a bad thing, Goldman said.
0.1	2	For example, he cites Lennon's disillusioning meeting with Presley at Graceland in 1965.
0	2	John was very hooked into Elvis.
0	2	Elvis was his measure of success, said Goldman.
0	2	And the myth of Elvis: awesome.
0	2	But the reality of Elvis: a mess.
0.0941176470588235	2	Goldman also rejected the complaint raised by Ono, McCartney, Julian Lennon and others that Lennon is an easy target to defame because he's no longer around to answer the allegations.
0	2	You can't say John lacks for defenders.
0	2	And Yoko isn't dead.
0	2	Colonel Parker isn't dead.
0.133333333333333	2	Ninety-five percent of the people in my books aren't dead.
0	2	They can do something about it, said Goldman, his voice quickening.
0	2	This business of making it easy for defending myself is insane.
0	2	I'm the target of scores of attacks.
0	2	I can't imagine a harder thing for an author.
0.246153846153846	2	Those attacks don't really bother him, unless they come from someone who hasn't read The Lives of John Lennon, Goldman said.
0	2	A lot of people already made up their minds.
0.1	2	They hear Albert Goldman, John Lennon, homosexuality bang, let him have it!
0	2	I resent people commenting on a book they haven't read, including Yoko, the author said.
0.246153846153846	2	Ono's reaction came on a nationally broadcast response to the book.
0.110344827586207	2	She labeled Goldman's version of life with the Lennons totally fiction and brought out Lennon's sons, Julian and 12-year-old Sean, to refute the biography.
0	2	These giant promotions of Yoko are presented as honest documentaries, when they're in-house documentaries, said Goldman, who complimented Ono on a well-prepared show.
0	2	She takes no chances.
0	2	This was another no-chance Yoko.
0	2	As for the sensational charges of bisexuality, drug abuse by Yoko and John, wild drinking binges, anorexia and reclusiveness, Goldman says it all fits together with the image of Lennon presented by those who knew him.
0.32	2	My thesis is John Lennon was a divided mind.
0	2	Every yin had a yang, said Goldman.
0	2	There is nothing more natural than for John to try the other side
0	2	That's just the kind of guy he was.
0	2	He wanted to try everything once.
0.106666666666667	3	Cynthia Lennon joins the throng denouncing the new, unauthorized biography of her late former husband, John Lennon, as written by a money-hungry author capitalizing on untruths.
0	3	People who write books like this, it is for greed, and as far as I'm concerned, they're gravediggers, no more, no less, Mrs. Lennon says on the CBS show 60 Minutes scheduled for broadcast Sunday evening.
0	3	Grave robbers, body snatchers, you name it, they are it.
0.872727272727273	3	The biography by Albert Goldman, The Lives of John Lennon, depicts the former Beatle as an anorexic bisexual addled by drugs who raged his way from Liverpool to New York.
0	3	It was released Sept. 14.
0	3	Goldman, who defends his Lennon book and said it is based on 1,200 interviews, also has written controversial biographies of comedian Lenny Bruce and Elvis Presley.
0.08	3	Lennon was murdered outside his Upper West Side home on Dec. 8, 1980, by Mark David Chapman.
0	3	All I know and all the people that love John know that we had our years that nobody, no film, no book will ever complete what went on in our lives.
0	3	That's our part of our hearts that has to stay with us, must not be public, Mrs. Lennon said.
0	3	I love John.
0	3	I've always loved John because he was my first love.
0	3	But, I mean, I've loved him in different ways.
0.32	3	I love his memory.
0	3	I loved what he did.
0	3	I understood his madness, his phases.
0	3	I just feel that I understood.
0.114285714285714	3	The couple divorced a few months before Lennon married Yoko Ono in 1969.
0.192	3	Ms. Ono already has trashed the book, calling it totally fiction in a nationwide broadcast that coincided with the release of the book.
0	3	She too was interviewed on the 60 Minutes show, entitled The Two Mrs. Lennons.
0.177777777777778	3	These people in this book are not us.
0	3	It's not John and me, Ono said in the taped radio broadcast.
0.0941176470588235	3	Cynthia and John's son, Julian Lennon, also denounced the book on the radio taping, calling it lies, untruths, and adding that the whole thing is just sickening.
0	3	Sean Lennon, the son of Yoko and John who is now 12, added his voice on the CBS broadcast, rebutting charges that his father was inattentive to parenting.
0	3	I think he did a lot of fathering in the five years that I knew him, Sean says.
0	3	He spent so much time with me not just at home, but everywhere, you know.
0	4	I believe in fairies, the myths, dragons.
0	4	It all exists, even if it's in your mind.
0	4	Who's to say that dreams and nightmares aren't as real as the here and now?
0	4	Reality leaves a lot to the imagination.
0.278260869565217	4	Watching the new movie, Imagine: John Lennon, was very painful for the late Beatle's wife, Yoko Ono.
0	4	The only reason why I did watch it to the end is because I'm responsible for it, even though somebody else made it, she said.
0	4	Cassettes, film footage and other elements of the acclaimed movie were collected by Ono.
0	4	She also took cassettes of interviews by Lennon, which were edited in such a way that he narrates the picture.
0	4	Andrew Solt directed, Solt and David L. Wolper produced and Solt and Sam Egan wrote it.
0.24	4	I think this is really the definitive documentary of John Lennon's life, Ono said in an interview.
0	4	What John was really about is depicted in this film, very accurately and without whitewashing.
0	4	I did view it.
0	4	I didn't have them take any footage out.
0	4	I wanted the truth.
0	4	In the sense you had to put a 40-year life into an hour and a half; balance is a very serious consideration.
0	4	I think they did a remarkable job and very tastefully so.
0	4	There is a soundtrack album and a coffeetable book with comments primarily by Lennon, tied in with the film and using the same title.
0	4	Imagine there's no heaven It's easy if you try No hell below us Above us only sky Imagine all the people Living for today.
0	4	Imagine is more than a Lennon elegy.
0.0551724137931034	4	Though it fails to delve too deeply into the darker side of Lennon and the Beatles it does capture the music and the times in which Lennon lived.
0.0484848484848485	4	One intriguing episode in Imagine shows cartoonist Al Capp being antagonistic toward the Lennons during their bed-in, when they stayed in bed for a week to publicize their concern for peace.
0	4	We were naive, Ono said.
0	4	A lot of things happened because we were naive.
0	4	Maybe that was our strength.
0	4	To us, Al Capp was just a cartoonist and you naturally assume a cartoonist is liberal, with a sense of humor.
0	4	We didn't expect hostility.
0	4	Al Capp is one incident that was filmed.
0.213333333333333	4	In those days we did numerous interviews because of our stand for world peace.
0	4	There were some very rough interviews.
0	4	The hostility that was shown to us bluntly by reporters in those days was incredible.
0	4	Each time, I think we were hurt.
0.16	4	Ono said Lennon wrote the song Imagine in 1969 or
0	4	We did the bed-in, the Toronto Peace Festival, the Over' billboard.
0.213333333333333	4	He was saying we need an anthem for this whole concept of world peace.
0.0842105263157895	4	I think it's one of the songs that will really go on forever in people's minds.
0.0280701754385965	4	Imagine there's no countries It isn't hard to do Nothing to kill or die for And no religion too Imagine all the people Living life in peace You may say i'm a dreamer But i'm not the only one i hope someday you'll join us and the world be as one.
0.2	4	Lennon was born Oct. 9, 1940.
0.213333333333333	4	He was shot and killed outside his Manhattan apartment on Dec. 8, 1980.
0	4	Ono was a painter when Lennon met her.
0.246153846153846	4	She later joined him in music and in public demonstrations for peace.
0.0390243902439024	4	I think that for somebody like me, because I feel that I'm an artist and a creative artist, that it is a very strange turn of events that I'm known as a widow, she said.
0	4	But it is stranger to me that I'm not that disturbed by it.
0	4	I think that John promoted my work a lot in his lifetime and somehow it seems like it is a pleasure for me to sort of still work in a context of a partnership with him.
0	4	I think it is my turn to promote him.
0	4	He promoted me.
0.242424242424242	4	When Albert Goldman's The Lives of John Lennon was published in September, depicting the former Beatle as riddled with vices, faults and neuroses, Ono called it totally fiction.
0	4	Since then she's received a tremendous amount of support from friends and fans.
0	4	I was very touched and thankful that people sent letters to me and extended hands at this time, very warmly.
0	4	I really appreciate that.
0	4	I was also surprised that so many people stood up against it
0	4	I didn't expect that, Ono said.
0.152380952380952	4	Lennon's half sister, Julia Baird, also has written a new book, John Lennon, My Brother.
0	4	She has no idea how many books have been written about Lennon; she's been sent some of them but hasn't read them.
0.2	4	I know the life and it is too painful to read somebody else's version.
0	4	There's still enough footage, Ono said, for another movie perhaps a music or political or art film.
0.133333333333333	4	And there's another big John Lennon project on her horizon.
0	4	It's from unpublished songs which were written for a Broadway musical.
0	4	I don't know if it would have gotten to Broadway.
0	4	You aim for the stars, you know.
0.228571428571429	4	The songs might be strung together.
0	4	They might become a record, might eventually become a musical.
0	4	There are enough finished songs.
0	4	They were never recorded in the studio.
0	4	They're on cassettes.
0.0695652173913043	4	Their son Sean, 13, like his older half-brother, Julian, has become interested in music and started playing guitar.
0	4	I had reservations about Sean going into the music field.
0	4	I still do.
0	4	But I kind of gave up on it, Ono said.
0	4	He is into guitar now.
0	4	A session musician, a very good one, was teaching him.
0	4	According to this teacher, it seems like he is very good.
0	4	He is just totally involved in it, listening to Eric Clapton, Jimi Hendrix, his dad's songs only for guitar playing, I think.
0	4	He is into it so much, good luck to him.
0.0592592592592593	5	The image of a dour, shoeless English boy and his absent, carefree mother prompted Julia Baird and Geoffrey Giuliano to collaborate on a book.
0.0842105263157895	5	The boy is the public image of young John Lennon, Baird's half-brother and Giuliano's idol.
0	5	But the neglected urchin and his live-it-up mother who was also Baird's mother never existed, the authors say.
0	5	That woman laughing, singing, dancing, saying goodbye to John, and John standing there alone crying Mummy!'
0.0347826086956522	5	That's not my brother, that's not my mother, that's not my children's grandmother, said Baird, who recently spent three weeks in the United States promoting her book, a family portrait of Lennon and his Liverpool roots.
0.0470588235294118	5	Published in North America last fall, John Lennon, My Brother was co-authored by Giuliano, a Beatles aficionado who lives in this Erie Canal city about 25 miles north of Buffalo.
0	5	The two-year, cross-Atlantic collaboration came from two different motives.
0.177777777777778	5	Giuliano wanted to do a book about Lennon.
0	5	Baird wanted to do a book about the ex-Beatle's maligned mother, whose name also was Julia.
0	5	The result is a little of both, a mishmash of anecdotes showing a moody but generally happy Liverpool boy singing with his mother in a bathroom with good acoustics.
0.0444444444444444	5	Baird disagrees with other biographies which say that after his father decamped and Julia turned her son over to her sister, Mimi, Lennon was a grim youth who felt abandoned by his mother.
0	5	I didn't do it for John, said Baird.
0	5	I wanted to set the record straight about our mother, and that ties in with John.
0	5	I feel my mother has been badly misrepresented in the press.
0.0592592592592593	5	Baird, a 41-year-old teacher in Cheshire, England, was born seven years after Lennon to Julia and her common-law second husband, John Dykins.
0	5	She and her younger sister, Jacqui, grew up with their parents amid an extended family of aunts, uncles, cousins and big brother John.
0.0533333333333333	5	The book tells of the sisters getting hauled out of the bathtub when teen-agers Lennon, Paul McCartney and George Harrison drop by for bathroom jam sessions with Julia.
0	5	It tells of an alternately thoughtless and protective brother who leaves his step-sisters at the movies for hours while he goes on a date, who between songs at a Beatles concert shouts for security guards to lift the Dykins girls out of the front row, away from screaming fans threatening to storm the stage.
0.08	5	But mostly it tells of a mother and son who, while living apart, had a loving relationship.
0.208695652173913	5	The book got its start after Baird watched a British television special in 1985 marking the fifth anniversary of Lennon's murder.
0	5	The show presented Julia as an unfit mother, no mother at all, Baird said.
0	5	Baird complained and was urged to tell her story.
0.133333333333333	5	She wrote an essay and arranged to publish it in Liverpool.
0.152380952380952	5	Then she met Giuliano, who was in Liverpool to promote his first book, The Beatles: A Celebration.
0	5	Giuliano, 35, a self-proclaimed huckster, convinced Baird to work with him on a book, which he pieced together from interviews with Baird in England.
0	5	While proofreading the text, Baird sent a copy to McCartney.
0.3	5	He sent his blessing, plus a bonus: a brief foreword for the book.
0.0842105263157895	5	With a collection of rare early photos, the book is more a family album than a biography.
0	5	Giuliano's text reads like oral history, as if a British schoolteacher had spread the family scrapbook across the reader's knees to boast about her brother, the musician.
0.08	5	However, the book is a narrow view of Lennon, a child's recollections of an aspiring brother.
0.0864864864864865	5	After Julia was killed in a traffic accident in 1958, Baird saw less and less of Lennon, losing contact with him for years when he and wife Yoko Ono moved to the United States.
0.1	5	The end of the book describes what Baird calls Lennon's desire to regain his lost Liverpool roots, when she and her step-brother exchanged letters and phone calls during 1975-80.
0.0592592592592593	5	Baird has been accused of cashing in on her step-brother but insists she just wants to tell the family's story of Lennon's early years.
0	5	I could have cashed in when John was alive, Baird said.
0	5	When John died the tabloids in England were knocking on the door saying, your story, name your price.'
0	5	We quickly showed them the door.
0.275862068965517	5	Also shown the door was Albert Goldman, whose sordid biography, The Lives of John Lennon, hit bookstores about the same time as Baird's book.
0	5	Baird, who read Goldman's scathing biography of Elvis Presley, said she turned down an interview with Goldman, who brands Lennon homosexual, anorexic and possibly a murderer.
0.0666666666666667	5	I had heard Goldman was doing the book six years ago, and I knew what the tone would be, Baird said.
0	5	Most people, including Goldman, write books based on other books that have it all wrong.
0	5	Giuliano was harsher.
0	5	Goldman was in it for the money from day one, Giuliano said.
0	5	Goldman knows the formula: the more sleaze, the more dough.
0	5	So what's his motive?
0	5	If he writes the sleaziest book he makes the most dough.
0	5	Baird herself wasn't blind to the business end of publishing.
0.0941176470588235	5	She agreed to change the title from My Brother John to John Lennon, My Brother.
0.0592592592592593	5	The cover's look-alike photos of Baird and Lennon in granny specs also help, but she said she didn't don them to sell books.
0	5	They're on the National Health, Britain's medical plan, and she and Lennon inherited their mother's short-sightedness, Baird said.
0.0888888888888889	5	The book itself is a loving look through rose-colored specs of a brother whose art touched millions.
0	5	It's not a major biography, Giuliano said.
0	5	This book is a little slice out of a big pie, out of a big life.
0.114285714285714	5	It offers a lot of previously unknown details on Lennon's early life.
0	5	It's a sympathetic view, sure, but what's not to love?
0.110344827586207	6	Thousands of John Lennon fans, some too young to remember the Beatles, swayed and sang along with songs including his anthem Imagine at a hometown tribute.
0	6	It's a great day, isn't it?
0.727272727272727	6	Lennon's widow, Yoko Ono, asked the crowd.
0	6	I think John would be happy, too.
0.0333333333333333	6	At the close of the concert, she and son Sean, 14, wept and hugged some of the musicians, who included B.B. King, Joe Cocker, Roberta Flack, the Moody Blues, Hall and Oates, Wet Wet Wet and Randy Travis.
0	6	However, the turnout was only 15,000, according to police estimates.
0	6	Organizers had hoped for about 45,000.
0	6	Tickets were $41 for the charity benefit concert, which featured a program of Beatles and Lennon songs.
0.177777777777778	6	The concert was televised in Britain and was to be rebroadcast worldwide in October in a 50th birthday tribute to Lennon a decade after his death.
0	6	Cyndi Lauper, in a white minidress, sang Hey Bulldog, and Dave Edmunds, backed by the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra, did the Beatles classic, A Day in the Life.
0	6	Soul singer Al Green was the opening act.
0	6	His version of All You Need is Love, turned into a singalong with the crowd, and Kylie Minogue did Help.
0	6	American actor Christopher Reeve was among the hosts of the concert.
0	6	Ex-Beatles George Harrison, Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr did not attend, but McCartney and Starr made taped contributions.
0	6	On tape, Starr performed I Call Your Name and said, John had the biggest heart of any man I have ever met to this day.
0	6	He was a giving, loving, caring human being.
0	6	He was crazy as well some days but the guy would give you his heart.
0.0516129032258065	6	Lennon's co-songwriter, Paul McCartney, said on his tape: Hello Liverpool, scene of many great memories, John, me and the rest of the lads.
0.213333333333333	6	The Beatles were raised in Liverpool and got their start in the Merseyside bars.
0	6	All the musicians assembled on stage for Give Peace a Chance, as the enthusiastic audience sang along, waved and clapped.
0	6	The concert closed with a recording of Lennon singing Imagine, while giant screens showed a video featuring John and Yoko.
0.133333333333333	6	Proceeds are to go to the Spirit Foundation, the charity founded by the Lennons in 1978, two years before Lennon was shot to death in front of his apartment in New York City.
0.228571428571429	6	Lennon was slain on Dec. 8, 1980, when he was 40.
0	6	The confessed killer, Mark Chapman, is serving a life prison sentence.
1	7	The 50th anniversary of John Lennon's birth was observed with a global celebration today as his peace anthem Imagine was played for an estimated 1 billion people in 130 nations.
0.738461538461539	7	The song was played shortly after 10 a.m. following a brief ceremony at the United Nations that featured the ex-Beatle's widow, Yoko Ono.
0.0888888888888889	7	Marcela Perez de Cuellar, wife of the U.N. secretary general, also provided a brief introduction.
0.133333333333333	7	A recorded message from the slain Beatle was played as well.
0.177777777777778	7	In celebration of John's life, let's use our power of dreaming, Ono said.
0	7	Let's dream of trees growing in abundance, birds flying in clear air, fish swimming in clear water and our children living in joy.
0	7	Let's dream of men and women feeling good together and people embracing each other regardless of their creed and religion, she said.
0	7	Let's dream of all races praising one another in the knowledge that the differences are what makes the human race.
0	7	The U.N. Trusteeship Council Chamber was about one-third full with a couple of hundred people for the observance and about 150 people watched on television monitors in the visitors' lobby.
0	7	A group of 10 teen-agers in blue jeans and T-shirts sat on the floor, held hands and meditated.
0	7	More than 1,000 radio stations and networks from 50 countries had signed on for the satellite broadcast by last week.
0.123076923076923	7	U.S. Armed Forces television and radio beamed the event to 80-plus countries.
0	7	MTV was to broadcast the program in 25 countries, said network spokeswoman Andrea Smith.
0	7	More than 50 fans gathered at the late Beatle's sidewalk star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in Los Angeles to honor the singer-songwriter.
0	7	Some held candles and others carried birthday balloons.
0.533333333333333	7	Beatles fans gathered in Liverpool today to pay tribute to Lennon.
0	7	Civic dignitaries planned to join them at the city's Cavern Walks shopping precinct on the ite of the legendary Cavern Club where the group was discovered.
0.118518518518519	7	In New York, fans planned a tearful pilgrimage to the spot outside the Dakota apartment building where Lennon was gunned down almost 10 years ago.
0	7	Lennon always symbolized for us somebody who was able to handle rock and roll with a sense of humor and later, even more importantly, as someone who cared for the rights of an individual, human rights in general, and who had the right concept of freedom and peace, said Ondrej Konrad, the editor of Czechoslovakia's leading popular music publication.
0.0695652173913043	7	Jeff Pollack, head of the California-based Pollack Media Group, proposed the idea to Ono, who gave it the go-ahead.
0.123076923076923	7	She believes recent events around the world in Germany, Eastern Europe and particularly the Middle East show the importance of Lennon's peace message.
0	7	When this was discussed, we had no knowledge of what would happen in Iraq and Kuwait, you know.
0.0888888888888889	7	And now it seems very appropriate that this be sung all over the world, Ono said.
0	7	I don't know, the timing is incredible.
0	7	It's beyond me It's beautiful.
0.106666666666667	7	Imagine is Lennon's musical vision of a world free of war and poverty.
0.0571428571428571	7	Lennon was born Oct. 9, 1940 and helped lead the Beatles to international stardom, along with co-members Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr.
0.376470588235294	7	He fatally gunned down by an obsessed fan outside his Manhattan apartment building in December 1980.
0.0761904761904762	7	The tribute coincides with the release of a four-compact disc set of 73 songs, including 61 written by Lennon.
0.177777777777778	7	Also in honor of Lennon's 50th birthday, McCartney is releasing his live version of Birthday.
0.106666666666667	8	On the spot where Lenin once spoke, the focus Tuesday was on Lennon.
0.0820512820512821	8	Official newspapers, which once denounced the Beatles as harmful pests from the decadent West, joined a worldwide celebration and ran stories of tribute about the late John Lennon, who would have turned 50 on Tuesday.
0.32	8	State radio broadcast his music and interviews about him.
0	8	Two concerts devoted to the songwriter, guitarist and singer, who was shot to death in 1980, were held in Moscow.
0	8	Even the staid state television program Vremya got into act.
0.110344827586207	8	An anchorman, more accustomed to reading official government news, reported on the worldwide Lennon birthday bash and called his song Imagine, an anthem of peace.
0	8	The broadcast ended with an instrumental version of Yesterday playing as temperatures from around the nation rolled across the screen.
0	8	The celebration was a dramatic turnabout from Soviet authorities' repression of Beatles fans and supression of their music in earlier times.
0	8	Their music was banned and the Soviet press condemned them.
0	8	A 1964 article, for instance, commented, These bugs can swiftly ignite the very darkest and primitive passions.
0.0484848484848485	8	About 1,000 Soviets, mostly second generation Beatles fans, flocked to the Moscow Electrical Lamp Factory's cultural hall in northeastern part of the city to rejoice in Lennon's music.
0.0470588235294118	8	A plaque outside the hall reminded Beatles fans that Lennon's near namesake, Vladimir Lenin, the founder of the Soviet state, had spoken at the spot in 1917 and 1919.
0.0484848484848485	8	Inside, fans listened to recordings of Lennon's music, attended a concert of about a dozen Soviet rock bands, bought his albums and posters and reflected on his life.
0	8	He's like a hero, a symbol for every person: a symbol of honesty, talent, devotion to his ideals, notion of love, equality between people and goodness, said Irina Dykomkina, the 21-year-old secretary of the Sgt. Pepper's Club, a Soviet Beatles fan club formed two years ago.
0.145454545454545	8	Lennon's music, she said, crosses borders easily.
0.08	8	His music is so sincere, it's so understandable, even to people who don't know English.
0	8	They feel the music.
0	8	Andrei Trushkin, a correspondent for Komsomolskaya Pravda the Communist Party youth newspaper that devoted a full page Tuesday to Lennon said he appeals to Soviet youth in part because he was a rebel, like many of them, and was a difficult teen-ager.
0	8	The cops would have locked him up many times, said Trushkin, who helped organize the concert.
0	8	Tuesday's concert opened in the spirit of a birthday party.
0.0842105263157895	8	Balloons floated down from the balconies as a tape of Lennon's song, Starting Over, played.
0	8	The stage was adorned with a painting of Lennon and life-size cardboard cutouts of the Fab Four in front of the British flag.
0	8	shouted the audience, which included a few soldiers in uniform.
0	8	Onstage, the groups Sprint, Quiet Hour and Optimal Variant played in Beatles style but were joined by a group that didn't quite fit in the genre, an American-style country ensemble that wore plaid vests and performed Night Train to Memphis.
0.517647058823529	9	John Lennon's worldwide message of peace was delivered Tuesday as his song Imagine was played simultaneously for 1 billion people in 130 countries to celebrate what would have been his 50th birthday.
0	9	A dream we dream alone is only a dream, but the dream we dream together is reality.
0	9	Happy birthday, John.
0.246153846153846	9	The world is better today for sharing a time with you, Yoko Ono said at a United Nations ceremony before the playing of Imagine.
0	9	The slain former Beatle himself issued a call for harmony in a taped message that served as an introduction to the music.
0	9	We all want peace, whatever sort of job we have.
0	9	Think of your children.
0	9	Do you want them to be killed or don't you?
0	9	And that's the choice we have in front of us.
0	9	War or peace, said Lennon, whose son Sean turned 15 Tuesday.
0.12972972972973	9	None of the other Beatles were at the United Nations, but a tribute came from Lennon's old songwriting partner, Paul McCartney, who released a live version of the Beatles' tune Birthday.
0.0695652173913043	9	The song, originally on the White Album, was the first Lennon-McCartney single released since the Beatles broke up in 1969.
0.05	9	The release date and John's birthday is just a happy coincidence, but it's also a nod and a wink to my old mate, said McCartney, 47.
0.266666666666667	9	Other observances were held from Liverpool to Moscow to Los Angeles.
0.0666666666666667	9	In Lennon's hometown in England, fans gathered at the former site of the Cavern Club, where the Beatles were discovered.
0.266666666666667	9	Among those attending was Lennon's 71-year-old uncle, Charlie Lennon.
0	9	When asked how his nephew would have reacted to the ceremonies, he said: If he had been alive I doubt he would have come and even if he had, he would sat with me in the pub and had a good laugh.
0.121518987341772	9	On the West Coast, about 50 people part of an estimated 1 billion people worldwide who had access to the event stood near Lennon's star on the Walk of Fame and listened to the Imagine broadcast: Imagine all the people, living life in peace You may say I'm a dreamer, but I'm not the only one I hope some day you'll join us And the world will live as one.
0	9	His spirit still lives in all of us whose lives have been touched with him, Ono said of her late husband.
0	9	I would like us to remember and celebrate his birthday as a day of love, because he was a man of love, and because love is much needed at this time in our lives.
0	9	Ono was greeted by Marcela Perez de Cuellar, wife of the U.N. secretary-general.
0.0551724137931034	9	During her brief remarks, Ono also quoted a line from another of Lennon's songs, Happy Xmas Remember, war is over if you want it.
0	9	More than 1,000 radio stations and networks from 50 countries broadcast the 10-minute event.
0.123076923076923	9	U.S. Armed Forces television and radio beamed it to 80-plus other countries.
0	9	MTV televised the Imagine video in 25 countries, said Andrea Smith, a spokeswoman for the network.
0.0457142857142857	9	In Moscow, about 1,000 Soviets gathered at the Moscow Electrical Lamp Factory's cultural hall to listen to Lennon's music, snap up his albums and posters and reflect on his life.
0	9	Even the staid state television program Vremya got into the act.
0.0888888888888889	9	An anchorman, reporting on the worldwide birthday bash, described Imagine as an anthem of peace.
0	9	The broadcast ended with an instrumental version of Yesterday.
0	9	Not so long ago, the Beatles' music was banned in the Soviet Union.
0	9	In 1964, one commentator warned that these bugs can swiftly ignite the very darkest and primitive passions.
0.4	9	Lennon was shot to death by a deranged fan outside his Manhattan apartment building on Dec. 8, 1980.
0	10	At this point, Lennon says he became a househusband to their child while Yoko ran the family business.
0	10	The arrangement continued until Lennon told the woman he called Mother it was time to make music again.
0.08	10	Double Fantasy followed just before John's death, although it was not to be Lennon's swan song.
0	10	Bruce Springsteen has released three albums since 1980; Michael Jackson two.
0.114285714285714	10	In contrast, Lennon or, more accurately, Ono has released five albums: Milk and Honey, Menlove Ave., the movie soundtrack Imagine, the John Lennon Live in New York collection and a boxed CD collection for Christmas
0	10	In addition, The Lost Lennon Tapes, featuring hours of unreleased Lennon music, became a popular syndicated radio program.
0.228571428571429	10	Ono has overseen all these projects.
0	10	People ask me, would he have done in the
0	10	I say, talk about what he HAS done in the because he has definitely, she said.
0	10	In spirit, I think he's alive, and we're getting the benefit.
0.1	10	Others charge Ono with turning her memories into millions without concern for Lennon's image.
0	10	A Fame magazine profile derided her as The Merry Widow; the now-defunct weekly 7 Days described her as the decade's premier celebrity civil defendant.
0	10	Greed, insensitivity, egomania.
0	10	None of Ono's alleged faults are apparent in an interview.
0	10	In October, a barefoot Ono greeted a visitor to the Dakota in a high-ceilinged first-floor room with white carpet and black onyx walls.
0.05	10	Curled up on a chair, she serenely sipped herbal tea from a mug decorated with a Lennon drawing of John and Yoko with the inscription, Grow Old With Me.
0.0571428571428571	10	The mug is one of an assortment of Lennon collectibles available from Bag One Arts Inc., the entity that controls reproductions of Lennon's art work.
0	10	Some of that black on white artwork which includes doodles jotted down on napkins, the margins of letters or stray scraps of paper has been colorized or redone in neon at Ono's order.
0	10	People would ask if we had anything in color, says Lynne Clifford, who runs Bag One for Yoko.
0	10	And Yoko said, feel confident enough to add the color myself.
0	10	So she took the original sketches and we made plates and she added colors.
0	10	Lithographs that sold for $400 four years ago have increased as much as 10 times in value, she says, and new ones cost between $600 and $700.
0.0484848484848485	10	Although Bag One's gallery a few blocks from the Dakota deals primarily in lithographs, it also sells the collectibles, including $3 laminated bags that bear Lennon's drawings.
0	10	Yoko wanted everybody to be able to walk away with something, explained Clifford.
0	10	Where does all the money go?
0	10	Yoko is very funny about where the money goes.
0	10	But some goes to the Spirit Foundation, she said.
0	10	The foundation, established by Lennon and Ono before John's death, has contributed to causes ranging from a home for drug addicted children to bulletproof vests for police officers.
0.145454545454545	10	Is there anything that will never bear Lennon's sketch-work?
0	10	Socks, Clifford said.
0	10	Yoko said she couldn't imagine people walking around on John's drawings.
0	10	Back at the Dakota, Ono receives a familiar question: Is this all commercialism?
0	10	Has the iconoclastic ex-Beatle been sold out?
0	10	I didn't sell out John.
0	10	And I'm sure John would be happy I'm still keeping him out there.
0	10	There's a commercial aspect, yes, but I mean, why not?
0	10	I was a partner, and I still feel that I'm a partner.
0.0941176470588235	11	Drummer Andy Newmark was touring with Roxy Music in the summer of 1980 when he got the call that changed his life: He was to play on John Lennon's new album.
0	11	Lennon had been in virtual seclusion for five years, busy taking care of his son, Sean, and admittedly out of songwriting ideas.
0.177777777777778	11	But in 1980, he suddenly felt inspired again and planned to return to the studio to make an album with his wife, Yoko Ono.
0	11	It was more than a superstar session.
0	11	Afterall, Lennon gave no press conferences, and didn't attend clubs or concerts.
0	11	Rare photos occasionally emerged and he looked different in each one
0.0533333333333333	11	Producer Jack Douglas, who had worked with Lennon as an engineer, recruited Newmark, bassist Tony Levin, guitarist Hugh McCracken and other New York-based sessions players.
0	11	Recording was to take place at the Hit Factory in Manhattan.
0.133333333333333	11	To Newmark, Lennon was a hero and only a hero.
0	11	He didn't know him and was nervous about working with him.
0	11	The drummer guessed he was something like the intense, irreverent young man of the movies Help!
0	11	and A Hard Day's Night.
0.228571428571429	11	Lennon was those things and more.
0.0941176470588235	11	His personality seemed so consistent with all we had ever heard about John Lennon, said Newmark, who still lives in New York and works with former Roxy Music singer Bryan Ferry.
0	11	His straightforwardness was as visible and apparant as the stories and images we had created.
0	11	I didn't see anything that seemed startlingly new to the myth.
0.0666666666666667	11	It just appeared to be what we had imagined: down to earth, direct, so direct it could not offend people.
0.106666666666667	11	Newmark spent just one month in the studio, playing on the songs that eventually ended up on Double Fantasy and Milk and Honey, Lennon's final albums.
0	11	It was the best experience of my life, he insisted.
0	11	The highlight of my career.
0	11	The nerves quickly settled.
0.0727272727272727	11	Once recording began, Lennon was just a working musician with the same goal as everyone else: finishing the album.
0	11	The music was mostly mainstream pop; no 18-minute jams or political anthems.
0	11	I hate all that fancy stuff, Lennon told his drummer.
0	11	Keep it simple, like Ringo.
0	11	He was a happy man at this point and his singing was higher, sweeter than on earlier albums.
0.218181818181818	11	Lennon was hoping to get back in touch with his audience, and the songs were melodic, the production lush.
0	11	Dear Yoko and Grow Old With Me were tributes to his wife.
0	11	Beautiful Boy was for Sean.
0	11	Lennon defended his self-imposed retirement on Watching the Wheels and summed up his feelings about turning 40 on Borrowed Time, capping the line Good to be older with a self-assured you bet.
0	11	Between takes, Lennon jammed on Buddy Holly songs and played host.
0	11	Sushi was the food of choice.
0	11	The strongest drug was Brazilian coffee, freshly ground.
0	11	Guys, I'm taking off, Lennon would say as he poured himself another cup.
0	11	And there were plenty of stories about the Beatles the B's, as John called them.
0	11	Reunions were out of the question, a return to adolescence in his opinion, but talking about the old days seemed the nicest kind of high.
0	11	By this time he was old enough to look upon the work they did and be proud of it, Newmark said.
0	11	When he talked about the it was as if it was his band.
0	11	He was the spiritual leader.
0	11	I felt that a lot through the sessions.
0.0592592592592593	11	By the fall, Newmark had finished working on the album, and his contact with Lennon was limited to an occasional visit to the studio.
0	11	But he had planned on working with him again.
0	11	Milk and Honey was to come out the following year and Lennon wanted to tour, using many of the same musicians.
0	11	Life is what happens when you're busy making other plans, Lennon once sang.
0.04	11	It took the drummer a long time to recover from Lennon's murder the night of Dec. 8, 1980; he didn't even feel like working for the next few years everything else suddenly seemed second rate.
0	11	Newmark never listens to the record, but still hears Woman on the radio.
0	11	When he thinks about it now, it's not so much a particular song that hurts him, it's the day-to-day stuff: the jokes and wisecracks, the coffee and the stories.
0	11	No one had a reason to remember all that at the time; those weren't supposed to be farewell sessions.
0	11	When I looked in his eyes, I felt a tremendous depth of character and a tremendous understanding of the human condition, a tremendous amount of compassion,, Newmark said.
0	11	He was totally friendly and open to everybody, including the janitor.
0	11	He had time for everybody.
0	11	That working class hero thing, he was trying to be real about that.
0.266666666666667	12	Dozens of fans of rock legend and former Beatle John Lennon gathered in the snow on a windy Saturday for a ceremony marking the 10th anniversary of his death.
0	12	Liverpool's mayor, Dorothy Gavin, led Lennon devotees who laid wreaths at the foot of a bronze statue of The Beatles in the city's Cavern Walks shopping center.
0	12	The center was built on the original site of the Cavern Club, made famous when The Beatles played there in the 1960s, and has become a place of pilgrimage.
0.0695652173913043	12	Give peace a chance, the title of one of singer-songwriter Lennon's greatest hits, was the theme for the day.
0.0571428571428571	12	Many friends and followers of Lennon were present, including Father Tom McKenzie, immortalized as Father MacKenzie in The Beatles' l966 hit song Eleanor Rigby.
0.15	12	On Friday, a small group of invited guests had gathered at Liverpool's Beatles Museum to watch Mrs. Gavin unveil a plaque marking the 10th anniversary of Lennon's death.
0.0842105263157895	12	John was always a son of Liverpool and over the last 10 years Liverpool has been very slow to recognize the fact that the Beatles came from Liverpool, said Lennon biographer Ray Coleman after the unveiling.
0.208695652173913	12	It is right that a world figure like Lennon should be recognized at last, said Coleman, author of John Lennon.
0.261818181818182	12	Lennon and his wife, Yoko Ono, were returning to their apartment in New York's Dakota apartment building after a recording session on Dec. 8, 1980, when Lennon was shot to death by Mark David Chapman, a deranged fan to whom Lennon had given his autograph only hours before.
0.8	12	Lennon was 40.
0	12	A spokesman for the Lennon family said Ms. Ono and the couple's son, Sean, were in Europe and would spend the anniversary privately.
0.0231884057971015	12	Journalist Andy Peebles, the last person to interview Lennon before he was shot, said in an interview with Sky satellitetelevision news: Ten years on, it's a ghastly feeling to think that you had spent seven hours with somebody you have been a fan of for years, and I think I left thinking is great, he's in really good shape.'
0.0551724137931034	12	Peebles said late in 1980 that Lennon had just recovered from a period when he had gone off the rails and his relationship with Ms. Ono had suffered.
0	12	But they'd had the baby, Sean had been born, and everything was great.
0	13	NIXON, disco, LSD it's no surprise, really, that those rejects have staged comebacks.
0.4	13	But Yoko Ono?
0.0761904761904762	13	The flaky avant-garde artist whose idea of music was to scream inside a plastic bag while John Lennon played guitar?
0	13	The Evil One who single-handedly killed the Beatles and destroyed her husband's talent and ambition?
0	13	Who could possibly regard her as anything other than a crackpot and a public menace?
0	13	Well, let's see: there's party rockers the B52s and cult singer Lene Lovich successful, critically acclaimed musicians who credit Ono's music as an influence.
0.0571428571428571	13	There's the Whitney Museum of Art, which exhibited Ono's artwork last year one of the 10 museum shows she has had around the world.
0	13	There's also the American Film Institute, which Ono says is staging an international tour of her experimental films.
0	13	And Ono's record label want to put out all my songs in a kind of CD box or something," Ono says.
0	13	She's used to rougher treatment.
0	13	Acceptance is a difficult concept for her.
0	13	used to sort of knocking the door rather than having the door opened and having to cope with entering it," Ono says during a telephone interview.
0.128	13	She's speaking from the New York office of Bag One Arts, the company Ono founded to promote Lennon's art and image.
0	13	Marketing an icon
0.15	13	Since his death in 1980, Ono has steadily kept Lennon products coming out: the albums and Honey" and Avenue" and the 4-CD boxed set John Lennon Collection"
0.213333333333333	13	the book by Word of Mouth," a collection of Lennon's unpublished writings
0.106666666666667	13	Lennon's art, which Ono says was his main interest in his final years
0.246153846153846	13	and Lennon-inspired merchandise, such as a line of John Lennon eyeglasses.
0	13	told the fans that I'm going to do 10 years of it.
0	13	Every year, hopefully, give a new product and share it with the fans," Ono says.
0.106666666666667	13	years, we had two or three products of John that came out."
0.3	13	The 10-year promise ended with last year's year-long celebration of Lennon's 50th birthday.
0	13	In 1991, Ono says, she has tried to a little and do my own stuff."
0.0695652173913043	13	Ono, 57, has been going into a recording studio every day to work on the proposed boxed-set of her music.
0	13	She continues to produce art and recently had a museum exhibit in Iceland.
0	13	Ono began her art career as an abstract impressionist, then went avant-garde.
0	13	She began doing performance art in the early long before the form was legitimized by art critics and government grants.
0	13	A life in two worlds
0	13	Ono declines to put a label on her current works.
0	13	She says that's for the critics to decide.
0	13	just like to create," she says.
0.139130434782609	13	Ono still lives in the Dakota apartment house in New York, the site of Lennon's murder by a crazed fan.
0.0372093023255814	13	On Dec. 8, 1980, the couple was returning home from the recording studio where they had been remixing on Thin Ice," one of the songs that would appear on Ono's most successful album, of Glass."
0	13	As they approached the entrance to the building, someone called out Lennon?"
0	13	Lennon turned, and Mark David Chapman shot him five times with a revolver.
0.188235294117647	13	After Lennon's death, there was speculation that Ono would leave the United States forever.
0	13	She did begin living part-time in Geneva.
0	13	theory was that I would live more and more in Geneva," Ono says.
0.2	13	it seems like circumstances are making me come back more and more to New York.
0	13	This is my hometown, that's how I feel about it.
0	13	It's a place where I can work very well."
0.0727272727272727	13	Ono was born in Tokyo her name means Child" and came with her family to the United States in 1936.
0.0666666666666667	13	Ono lived with her family in San Francisco and New York until the Japanese attack of Pearl Harbor forced them to return home.
0.32	13	In 1951, the Onos returned to New York.
0	13	Yoko married a Japanese composer when she was 23.
0	13	The marriage lasted seven years.
0	13	Ono married a second time in 1963, to avant-garde artist Tony Cox.
0	13	The couple had one child, a daughter named Kyoko.
0	13	In 1966, Ono and Lennon met.
0	13	He too was married and had a child, Julian.
0.2	13	Ono and Lennon were married in 1970.
0.133333333333333	13	There has been much speculation on Ono and Lennon's relationship.
0	13	Some say she controlled him.
0	13	was an extremely strong person," Ono says.
0	13	was no way to dominate him, even if I wanted to."
0	13	Others say Lennon used his relationship with Ono as an escape from things in his life that he felt were controlling him such as the Beatles.
0.0470588235294118	13	In May 1968, when the Beatles came together at the studio to work on Beatles," the two-record set commonly called White Album," Ono was at Lennon's side.
0	13	The two were inseparable.
0	13	According to at least one Beatles biographer, Ono even accompanied Lennon on trips to the bathroom.
0	13	The relationship between the Beatles especially Lennon and Paul McCartney was already strained.
0	13	Having Ono in the studio, offering suggestions and backing Lennon up in arguments, didn't help.
0	13	Still, the group already seemed headed toward a break-up, which finally came when McCartney sued the other Beatles to resolve an argument over the group's management.
0	13	So, no, Ono didn't break up the Beatles.
0	13	But it's also true that three of them didn't like her much.
0	13	Life after John
0	13	think the very fact that John and I got together hurt them a lot," she says.
0	13	We hurt them and they hurt us.
0	13	I can't really say it's a one-sided situation."
0	13	Ono says she feels no bitterness toward the surviving Beatles.
0	13	in this world are pretty harmless people," she says.
0	13	not doing anything like creating a nuclear bomb or trying to decide whether people should be killed.
0.123076923076923	13	They're pretty peaceful people and their songs will hopefully inspire people.
0	13	I have a lot of respect for them."
0	13	But how do the Beatles feel toward Ono these days?
0	13	varies," she says.
0	13	they are friendly, sometimes they are not like all relationships with friends.
0	13	I think that's natural."
0.0551724137931034	13	Many of the books that have been written about Lennon and the Beatles, especially Albert Goldman's loathing portrait of Lennon, have been painful to Ono.
0	13	But she says she isn't sure about writing her own version.
0	13	was hurt very much, and my son, too, by some of the things that were written," she says.
0	13	were lies and that's what hurt us.
0	13	again, when I think of writing my true story I could say is the truth' and write about things somebody did or whatever, but then I think about their children.
0	13	If you look at it from the big picture, maybe there was not such an incredible crime done to me."
0.12972972972973	14	Say what you want about Albert Goldman, the author of the new biography, Lives of John Lennon" but you've got to hand it to him: This guy is one ambitious sleazemonger.
0	14	Most best-selling pop biographers play it safe: They choose a celeb of respectable, not to say pristine, reputation, and then they proceed to blacken it, preferably by recounting vaguely sourced tales of sexual excess, chemical dependency, personal unkindness, raw business dealings, even, in some cases, dyslexia.
0	14	The resulting portrait of a dissipated ogre who can't spell is duly presented in hardback form to the public, which in turn is so shocked and disgusted that it forces itself to buy the biography by the millions.
0	14	A can't-miss formula, surely.
0	14	Albert Goldman's previous victim in the genre was Elvis Presley.
0	14	Now Mr. Presley was, if you'll forgive the expression, a fat target for a writer of Mr. Goldman's methods.
0	14	His title notwithstanding, the of Rock Roll" was in truth more a creature of the old show biz, a star whose wholesome image, carefully created by P.R. wizards, was ripe for debunking.
0.0761904761904762	14	But in choosing Mr. Lennon as his next target, Mr. Goldman appears to be trying to debunk the undebunkable.
0.0372093023255814	14	For apart from his puerile politics, Mr. Lennon's favorite topic in the thousands of interviews he gave was his own squalid history: His voracious drug use, his perfidy to employees, his unquenchable sexual promiscuity and so on.
0.0761904761904762	14	By his own accounting, then, Mr. Lennon was not about to dethrone Ward Cleaver as the all-American dad.
0	14	His public loved him in spite of it all or perhaps because of it all.
0	14	Mr. Lennon grew to celebrity during a time when such transgressions as intemperance and adultery
0	14	were losing their social sting.
0	14	His candor if that's what it was, and not simple logorrhea redeemed everything.
0	14	And so it is on the grounds of insufficient candor that the resourceful Mr. Goldman, hot to debunk, attacks his subject.
0.0914285714285714	14	The leitmotif of Mr. Lennon's confessions was that his worst days were behind him, and that with Yoko Ono he had at last learned to prize the virtues of quietude and domesticity.
0	14	Now Mr. Goldman is here to announce: He didn't tell you the half of it.
0	14	Hence this 718-page stew of unrelieved sordidness, percolating with the that have by now been widely publicized in People magazine, 57th" and other scholarly venues: that Mr. Lennon had a thing for young boys; that his marriage to Ms. Ono was pocked by the same faithlessness and rancor that characterized his first marriage; that he had a sweet tooth that just wouldn't quit.
0	14	The squalid revelations dribble out like a chemical leak, sliming up every page.
0.369230769230769	14	Remarkably, then, the sleazemonger's art has triumphed: Mr. Goldman's John Lennon is even worse than John Lennon's John Lennon.
0.041025641025641	14	A great deal of this muck manages to splash onto Ms. Ono, whom Mr. Goldman portrays as a cynical manipulator whose major talent lay in exploiting Mr. Lennon to further her own craving for fame and wealth.
0	14	Mr. Goldman, alas, allows to pass unremarked the obvious irony that this is a rather fine thumbnail sketch of himself as well.
0	14	The keepers of the Lennon flame have of course been quick to point this out.
0	14	Ms. Ono and her son have taken the path preferred by offended celebrities, they have hit the talk shows to display their wounds.
0.0421052631578947	14	And Rolling Stone magazine, long the house organ for the Lennon publicity machine, recently published an extensive rebuttal to the book, which was undercut by a tone of priggish indignation bordering on the comic.
0.16	14	Criticizing Lives of John Lennon" for insufficient respect to the fallen Beatle's legacy is rather off the point like condemning Charles Manson for his bad table manners.
0.133333333333333	14	The book may indeed be inaccurate, as critics have charged.
0.0666666666666667	14	But one can only hope that quibbles about its veracity do not obscure the countless other reasons to hate Mr. Goldman's book.
0	14	There is, for starters, the sloppy, pompous prose, so suggestive of the grad-school smoking lounge Mr. Goldman is the sort of writer who refers to pop songs as as though they were concerti.
0.064	14	There is his knowing, hipper-than-thou approach toward drugs, sex, music that gives him license to second-guess Mr. Lennon's every move.
0	14	And there is the awkward organization, in which minor events assume large proportions for the simple reason that they reflect badly on Mr. Lennon, while major events are skipped over lightly because there goes the advance!
0	14	they might reveal Mr. Lennon in a flattering light.
0.0857142857142857	14	All of which indicates why Lives of John Lennon" is such a wretched book: not because it makes a good man look bad, but because it shows no other purpose than to make a man whether a good man or a bad one, we laymen will probably never know look bad.
0.0761904761904762	14	John Lennon, while he was alive, did enough of that himself to satisfy all but the lowest appetites.

0	5	Nothing so important has happened in Soviet politics since 1917, when the Bolsheviks seized power.
0	5	In Moscow on Wednesday, the system the Bolsheviks and Joseph Stalin created finally collapsed.
0	5	A new historical epoch began.
0	5	Soviets had an experience comparable to those that transformed the outlooks of Poles, Hungarians, Czechs and Slovaks in 1989, when they learned they could finally be free.
0	5	Soviets' courage in resisting this putsch announced the arrival of a nation capable of self-governance.
0.0855614973262032	5	The people," as President Bush dubbed them, could not have miscalculated more profoundly.
0.100313479623824	5	They thought the issue was Mikhail Gorbachev, and apparently believed that by neutralizing Gorbachev and threatening everyone else, they could quickly take charge of the country.
0.299465240641711	5	But the people of the Soviet Union apparently concluded that the real issue was not Gorbachev himself, but the new political culture of freedom and even democracy that his reforms had created.
0	5	For the first time in their thousand-year history, Russians asserted their independence from autocracy, and the autocrats fell.
0	5	There will be much to sort out in the months ahead.
0	5	But almost certainly the failure of the counterrevolution will accelerate the democratic revolution it tried to choke.
0	5	That revolution will alter the country, creating a new, decentralized and probably smaller Soviet Union much more quickly than anyone anticipated.
0.121212121212121	5	Gorbachev's own standing also will be transformed by these events.
0	5	It seems unlikely that he can escape the consequences of his own past miscalculations especially the miscalculation that led him to embrace the very men who led this putsch against his rule.
0.15311004784689	5	Gorbachev was the most resourceful and creative political leader of the late 20th century, but this week he was trumped by Boris Yeltsin, who will now rightly be seen as the man who saved him.
0	5	Yeltsin had two talents that Gorbachev lacked.
0.242424242424242	5	One was the ability to stay close to the Russian people as their world was transformed by Gorbachev's revolution hence his thumping victory in this spring's first presidential election in Russia and Gorbachev's abysmal standing in the polls.
0.269360269360269	5	Yeltsin's second talent was his eagerness to challenge the apparatus of the Soviet Communist Party, the world from which both he and Gorbachev emerged.
0	5	Gorbachev could never shuck his party apparatchik's skin.
0.0440771349862259	5	Instead of reaching out to new ideas and new people as Yeltsin has, he surrounded himself with traditional Communist Party officials and worried about the impact of new schemes and ideas.
0.0909090909090909	5	Gorbachev thought Vladimir Kryuchkov of the KGB, Boris Pugo of the Ministry of Interior, Dmitri Yazov of the Red Army and Gennady Yanayev of the Communist Party were necessary bedfellows whose presence in his entourage could protect him from conservative forces that hated his reforms.
0	5	Instead, they turned out to be mortal enemies.
0	5	If they had been only personal enemies, Gorbachev might have been undone by them.
0.0808080808080808	5	But when they closed the new, liberal news media and reverted to the Stalinist tradition of the big lie, the members of the State Emergency Committee threatened not just Gorbachev but also the new Soviet Union a society that offered its citizens an unprecedented opportunity for dignity, self-reliance and freedom.
0	5	For years, Soviets and Western Kremlinologists had debated whether the changes that created this new Soviet Union were irreversible.
0	5	Tuesday, it became clear that they were.
0	5	Of course, Gorbachev initiated those changes, and history will credit him for that.
0.0606060606060606	5	He also refused to acquiesce to the state of emergency that those responsible for the coup apparently asked him to endorse last weekend.
0.0330578512396694	5	It is intriguing in assessing the coup's failure that men trained as thugs by some of the most violent and mean-spirited institutions created by any state could not, in their moment of truth, behave like thugs and kill their compatriots.
0	5	They left Gorbachev alive and Yeltsin at large
0.132231404958678	5	they let the Western media report their coup as it unfolded
0	5	and they allowed foreign radio stations to broadcast news of it back into the country.
0	5	Even their own news media, under strict control, conveyed the fact that there was widespread resistance to their attempted coup.
0.0581818181818182	5	By Tuesday night, the Emergency Committee was in a confrontation with the political legitimacy of Yeltsin, and this proved an unequal contest.
0.0346320346320346	5	As Gorbachev had previously discovered in his negotiations with Yeltsin over a new union treaty, the legitimacy provided by the 50 million votes that Yeltsin received in the elections for president of the Russian federation was a formidable political force.
0.0606060606060606	5	At first blush, the botching of the coup was surprising couldn't the vaunted KGB and its allies run an efficient putsch?
0	5	But these were representatives of the political class that turned one of the world's richest nations into a basket case.
0	5	Perhaps their coup should be seen as a desperate and forlorn effort to deny a truth that proved undeniable that the Stalinist system had failed so utterly there was simply no way to redeem it.
0.169133192389006	6	Mikhail Gorbachev and Boris Yeltsin launched a sweeping purge today that dealt a series of stunning blows to the Communist Party power structure, including the ouster of top officials, the sealing of party headquarters and the curtailing of party activities.
0	6	Yeltsin appeared today to be acting at least as an equal with Gorbachev, and the two clearly agreed on the replacement of old-guard officials by new reformers.
0	6	In fact, the two leaders reached an agreement that permits each man to assume the other's duties in an emergency, such as another coup attempt.

0.116363636363636	6	In his speech before the Russian parliament, Gorbachev was compelled to affirm as legitimate the decrees issued by Yeltsin during the three-day coup.

0	6	You could even call them traitors!
0.0440771349862259	6	At one point during the session, Gorbachev dramatically held up what he said were the minutes of a secret Cabinet meeting during the coup that revealed who backed the emergency decrees.
0.161616161616162	6	He said many of them and hawed," but most voted in support of the takeover.
0.0855614973262032	6	Today's meeting displayed unprecedented openness in which deputies repeatedly interrupted Gorbachev and argued with him.
0.0808080808080808	6	Gorbachev drew applause from deputies when he announced that the party's headquarters in Moscow was sealed.
0.323232323232323	6	The meeting of Gorbachev and Yeltsin was the first since the coup collapsed to discuss the takeover and to deal with officials who backed the putsch.

0.174545454545455	6	Yeltsin often commented during Gorbachev's speech, and Gorbachev deferred to him several times on details of what happened during Gorbachev's detention.

0	8	must say this has been a great drama for me, a severe trial."
0	8	Retribution for Yeltsin
0	8	Yeltsin seemed to take extraordinary relish in this Shakespearean drama of betrayal and retribution.
0.0559440559440559	8	It had been Gorbachev who ordered Yeltsin out of a hospital bed in 1987 to face a vengeful meeting of the Moscow Communist Party Committee.
0.111888111888112	8	At that session, one speaker after another attacked Yeltsin for immaturity" and other sins for daring to criticize the party and its Politburo.
0.0606060606060606	8	And it was Gorbachev in 1990 who came to the Russian parliament to call on deputies to vote against Yeltsin as their chairman.
0	8	Although this seemingly endless political saga of two reformers who can only struggle to find a common language seemed at an end this spring when they began negotiations on a new Union Treaty, it is clear that their relationship will likely remain the great floating opera of Soviet politics.
0.0808080808080808	8	Gorbachev said he and Yeltsin had also agreed to assume each other's duties in an emergency.
0	8	one or another gets in the situation when he cannot even give orders, like what happened now, his rights and responsibilities are automatically taken by the other," Gorbachev said.
0	8	It appeared that the move would have to be temporary and could be made permanent only with legislative consent.

0.132231404958678	8	Soviet Prime Minister Valetin Pavlov has been arrested for helping to lead the coup, Soviet and Russian television reported today.
0.0484848484848485	8	Pavlov was one of the eight officials in the committee that ousted Gorbachev from power, but he was reportedly taken ill on Sunday night when the coup began.
0	8	He has been under police guard in a hospital since Gorbachev regained power Wednesday.
0	8	Speculation of guilt also turned on another key figure in the old Gorbachev government.
0.111888111888112	8	According to Yeltsin, Supreme Soviet Chairman Anatoly Lukyanov has been ousted for taking part in the coup, but that has not been confirmed.
0.0808080808080808	9	IT IS the stuff of a Byzantine Cold War novel, enticing enough to grab the attention of even the most benign conspiracy theorist: Did Mikhail Gorbachev orchestrate the coup that almost overthrew him?
0	9	The blueprint for imposing a state of emergency was drawn by Gorbachev himself last winter.
0	9	He pushed through the legislation that included suspension of political activity and of freedom of the press.
0.076555023923445	9	He hand-picked the heads of the coercive institutions and other key officials who took part in the coup.
0	9	Gorbachev chose to ignore warnings about the right's impending attempt to seize power.
0.15311004784689	9	Some warnings came from Gorbachev's liberal advisers, such as Alexander Yakovlev, shortly before the coup.
0	9	But, incredibly, the clearest signals came from the hard-liners themselves.
0.0581818181818182	9	A leading conservative journalist, Alexander Prokhanov, known as the of the General Staff," published a transcript of his conversation with the head of the General Staff Academy, the commander-in-chief of the Soviet Navy and Gorbachev's deputy at the Defense Council, Oleg Baklanov.
0	9	With remarkable candor, Baklanov called for a military takeover as an appropriate step to avert reforms that would result in a fundamental transformation of the union.
0	9	Needless to say, Baklanov delivered on that warning and joined the Gang of Eight.
0	9	Gorbachev ignored these warnings.
0.0538720538720539	9	To some an admitted minority the thought of a Gorbachev conspiracy is comfortably within the range of the traditional Soviet art of deception known as maskirovka.
0	9	And to laymen, something that odd could make sense in a country where illness can mean anything from the flu to a precipitous fall from power.
0.0440771349862259	9	The most volatile fuel for the conspiracy theory came directly from Gorbachev himself, in his Thursday news conference in which he described his three days under house arrest in the Crimea.
0.0881542699724518	9	Among the questions: If Gorbachev's 32 armed guards remained loyal to him throughout, why was there no conflict with the opposition delegation that notified the president of the coup?
0.229665071770335	9	Why didn't the coup leaders incapacitate Gorbachev's guards, or at least separate them from him?
0.0330578512396694	9	If Gorbachev's contact with the outside world was limited to intercepting Western radio outlets on an ancient shortwave radio, how was he able to describe the news conference given by the collaborators, down to his view of their trembling hands?
0.100313479623824	9	It is highly unlikely that the hard-liners had been set up or ordered by Gorbachev to launch a hopeless coup attempt in order to improve his political standing.
0	9	Such a scenario would require an unprecedented degree of selfless commitment to Gorbachev on their part.
0.0440771349862259	9	A more plausible scenario is that Gorbachev was initially a full member of the conspiracy, which, with his participation, could have clung to the fig leaf of constitutionality and would have thwarted the new Union Treaty, to have been signed last Tuesday, which provided for transfer of key levers of power from the federal presidency to the leaders of republics.
0.0323232323232323	9	It is possible that, unwilling to take a huge risk and openly side with the hard-liners at the start of the coup, Gorbachev had decided to become ill and wait out the initial phase under virtually self-imposed confinement in his summer residence.
0.0661157024793388	9	Gorbachev did reveal, however, that two important officials had visited him in Crimea at the outset of the coup.
0	9	One was head of the KGB department responsible for the security of Soviet leaders
0.0581818181818182	9	the other was V. Boldin, Gorbachev's closest aide, by the president's own admission a man of absolute loyalty to him.
0.0316205533596838	9	One can't help but wonder whether these two visitors came to deliver an ultimatum to Gorbachev and put him under arrest in the event of his non-compliance, or to deliver important documents from fellow junta members at the outset of their joint enterprise.
0.0393120393120393	9	Conspiracy theorists grope for motives Gorbachev wanted to ferret out disloyal elements in his government, to make himself a hero and to delay the scheduled signing of a treaty that would have lessened his powers.
0	9	But there is virtually unanimous agreement on one point.
0.0632411067193676	9	Gorbachev put into power the very hard-liners who fronted the coup and kept them in power despite their vocal mutterings about him.

0.53125	1	She was 77.
0	1	She was old and, of course, I knew about the heart attack, so I was not shocked by her death, said Keith Thibodeaux, who at age 6 began playing Miss Ball's drum-playing son on the comedy series that continues in syndication around the world.
0	1	I'm sure all this is going to hit me a little later on.
0	1	Thibodeaux grew up on the set, playing Little Ricky from 1956 until 1961 under Miss Ball's watchful eye.
0	1	I think the thing I remember most about Lucy was that she was very much in control of everything, said Thibodeaux, who began playing the drums at age 2, was a professional drummer at age 4 and is now drummer with David and the Giants, a Christian rock group.

0.219827586206897	3	Lucille Ball, the daffy comedian whose harebrained schemes drove her television family crazy but delighted viewers for four decades, died Wednesday of a ruptured abdominal artery.
0.53125	3	She was 77.
0.141666666666667	3	The actress, star of the hugely popular I Love Lucy and related situation comedies seen in more than 80 countries, had undergone major heart surgery April 18.
0	3	She had been recovering steadily, getting out of bed and joking with the staff, but shortly before dawn Wednesday, she went into cardiac arrest due to internal bleeding and could not be revived, said Cedars-Sinai Medical Center spokesman Ronald Wise.
0	3	She suffered a complete heart failure at 5 a.m. and 47 minutes of resuscitation efforts proved fruitless, Wise said.
0	3	There was nothing to indicate this would happen, Wise said.
0	3	The heart itself apparently was not involved in Miss Ball's sudden death.
0	3	In the 6{-hour surgery at Cedars-Sinai, doctors replaced her aorta and aortic valve.
0	3	Although the replaced portion of Miss Ball's aorta did not apparently fail, the entire artery was in poor condition when she was operated upon, said Dr. Robert Kass.
0	3	Kass, who performed the operation, said at the time the tearing in Miss Ball's aorta progressed all the way down into her abdomen.
0.314814814814815	3	Miss Ball, with her fire-engine red hair and siren wail, was considered the queen of situation comedy and a pioneer of the sitcom format.
0	3	I and 100 million others will miss her, said comedian George Burns.
0.265625	3	But we haven't lost Lucille Ball because she's still with us on television and we can see her on and on.
0.265625	3	Lucille Ball possessed the gift of laughter.
0	3	But she also embodied an even greater treasure the gift of love, President Bush said in a statement.
0	3	She appealed to the gentler impulses of the human spirit.
0	3	She was not merely an actress or comedienne.
0	3	She was Lucy and she was loved.
0.0643939393939394	3	Her red hair, her antics on the screen, her timing and her zest for life made her an American institution, former President and Nancy Reagan said in a statement.
0	3	Just the mention of her name brings a smile.
0	3	We love Lucy and will miss her deeply.
0	3	It's a shock after working very closely with her and loving her for over 35 years, said Miss Ball's frequent sidekick, Gale Gordon, who was in Edmonton, Alberta.
0	3	While in the hospital, the comedian was deluged with thousands of cards, letters, flowers and phone calls from fans as far away as Australia and Europe.
0.495833333333333	3	Miss Ball and her late former husband, Desi Arnaz, starred in I Love Lucy from 1951 to 1957 and have been seen since in widely syndicated reruns.

0.0988372093023256	3	Miss Ball's real, onscreen pregnancy marked a milestone in television, and an estimated 44 million viewers more than for the inauguration of President Eisenhower tuned in on Jan. 19, 1953, to watch Lucy Ricardo have Little Ricky.
0	3	The real birth occurred just four hours before the previously-filmed show was broadcast.
0	3	Miss Ball's singularity as a comedian was matched by her talent as a show-business entrepreneur.
0.163461538461538	3	She and Arnaz established one of TV's first major independent studios.
0	3	Desilu, as their production company was called, made some of the top comedy shows of the 1950s and including December Bride, Our Miss Brooks and Make Room for Daddy.
0.046195652173913	3	As testament to their value as prime-time stars, Miss Ball and Arnaz signed an $8 million, no-cancellation, two-year contract with CBS in 1953 the largest in television history at the time and a figure scarcely any TV star can touch today.
0.53125	3	The couple stopped making weekly I Love Lucy shows in 1957.
0.482954545454545	3	Despite riches and two children, Lucie and Desi Jr., their marriage foundered, and the couple divorced in 1960.
0	3	In 1961, Miss Ball married nightclub comic Gary Morton, who became her executive producer, and remained on TV for 12 more years in the weekly Here's Lucy and The Lucy Show.
0	3	Miss Ball was born Aug. 6, 1911, in Jamestown, N.Y., the daughter of an electrician and a concert pianist.
0.0433673469387755	3	Young Lucy, a brunette, was dazzled by the stage, but her ambitions were discouraged by an acting school They sent my mother a letter saying she was wasting her money, Miss Ball once said and she turned to modeling under the name Diane Belmont.
0	3	Her ads for Chesterfield cigarettes caught Hollywood's eye, and in 1933 she went to California.
0	3	As a blonde, she appeared with the Marx Brothers in Room Service, with Fred Astaire in Follow the Fleet and with Katharine Hepburn and Ginger Rogers in Stage Door.
0.193181818181818	3	In all, she appeared in more than 75 movies.
0.10625	3	In 1940, her tresses colored the fiery trademark red, Miss Ball met Arnaz, a rumba star.
0	3	They married within six months.
0.0758928571428571	3	In 1951, when CBS decided to move her radio series, My Favorite Husband, to television, Miss Ball insisted that Arnaz be her co-star.
0	3	But the network wasn't sure Arnaz would be a hit with the American public.
0.151785714285714	3	The couple went on a nationwide vaudeville tour and proved audiences would watch a leggy, blue-eyed comedian and a Cuban-born band leader with a heavy accent.
0	3	They also produced their own pilot episode on borrowed money.
0.354166666666667	3	CBS relented, and I Love Lucy was an immediate success.
0.177083333333333	3	The show revolutionized television sitcom production in the days before videotape.
0.369565217391304	3	It was filmed in advance before a live audience, employing three cameras instead of the traditional one used for motion pictures.
0	3	The actress was last seen at the 61st Academy Awards ceremony March 29, where the svelte actress received a standing ovation and laughed freely throughout her brief bit with Bob Hope.
0.0923913043478261	3	Her last series Life with Lucy, once again co-starring Gordon was carried by ABC at the start of the 1986 season.
0.085	3	But the show, her first series in 12 years, was canceled after less than two months when it drew spectacularly low ratings.
0	3	She felt terrible.
0	3	It really devastated her, daughter Lucie Arnaz said at the time.
0	3	Miss Ball also played a bag lady in the 1985 TV movie Stone Pillow, considered one of the most challenging roles of her career.
0	3	She was hospitalized for dehydration when it was over, but the movie was a minor critical and ratings success.
0	3	Just this month, Miss Ball had signed a deal for a reported $750,000 with Putnam to publish her autobiography.

0	3	Lucy's extraordinary ability to light up the screen and brighten our lives is a legacy that will last forever.
0	3	Funeral arrangements were pending.
0.0607142857142857	4	Actor Gale Gordon, a sidekick of Lucille Ball from radio days who appeared with her in three television series, recalled on Wednesday how the comedian never thought of herself as particularly funny.
0	4	Oh, but when she told a story or recalled an event that happened she always illustrated it with her body and her face, the 83-year-old Gordon said in a telephone interview.
0	4	She never saw it, but she was extremely amusing.
0.0505952380952381	4	Gordon, who is appearing in a play in Edmonton, spent the day in an Edmonton hotel room, mourning the death of Lucille Ball in a Los Angeles hospital Wednesday at age 77 and quietly remembering his funny friend.
0	4	The world will miss her greatly, the actor said.
0	4	I personally will remember her as the best talent of her kind in the world a wonderful, warm friend and a bit of a genius the only one I've ever really known.
0.0923913043478261	4	In his first television series alongside Miss Ball, Gordon was the flustered banker Mr. Mooney in The Lucy Show from 1962-68.
0	4	The next six years saw him as Harrison Carter on Here's Lucy.
0	4	They were reunited briefly in 1986 for the short-lived Life With Lucy.
0.354166666666667	4	Gordon first met Miss Ball in 1947 on the radio program My Favorite Husband, which later became I Love Lucy on television.
0	4	I thought she was a very good-looking young woman, and very talented, he recalled.
0	4	She was very pleasant to work with.
0	4	None of us knew what was going to happen television was very young then and it wasn't taken too seriously.
0	4	We never dreamed it would ever become the power it was and the great stars it would produce.
0	4	Gordon last spoke to Miss Ball from Edmonton on his birthday, Feb. 20, when she called to wish me a happy birthday as she has done for years and years.
0	4	Gordon has done regular stints for years at a chain of Edmonton-based dinner theatres called Stage West.
0	4	He is currently appearing with that company's Mayfair Dinner Theatre as a priest in the play Mass Appeal.
0	4	The play has another month to run and Gordon says that means he won't be able to attend Miss Ball's funeral.
0	4	I couldn't do that because it would put people out of work, he said.
0	4	She would be the first one to scream her head off if I did that.
0	5	Bob Thomas has covered Hollywood for The Associated Press for 45 years.
0	5	She never knew how great she was.
0.236111111111111	5	Amid the blimp-size egos of the entertainment world, Lucille Ball stood out like an orange beacon.
0	5	She never bragged.
0	5	She never exercised her considerable power.
0	5	She always seemed astonished, even embarrassed, when honors inevitably came her way.
0	5	When she was to receive a humanitarian award from Variety Clubs on a CBS special five years ago, she told me: There comes a time in your life when you get a lot of plaques.
0	5	It's very flattering and I'll go along with it, especially if it benefits children.
0.141666666666667	5	Whenever she was praised for I Love Lucy, she invariably replied: Well, all of the credit should go to Madelyn Pugh and Bob Carroll Jr. Or, Desi was a genius: He was responsible for the show's success.
0	5	Or she cited co-stars Desi, Vivian Vance and Bill Frawley.
0.265625	5	Yes, the writing and producing and casting of I Love Lucy were marvelous, but Lucy's performance added the quantum force.
0	5	Her inspired pantomime could be written by no one: the growing panic as the chocolate assembly line speeded up; her catalog of pained expressions after tasting the patent medicine she was demonstrating.
0.386363636363636	5	Unlike many stars, Lucille Ball rarely indulged in self-analysis.
0.0965909090909091	5	But on one occasion she revealed why her feelings about the I Love Lucy triumph might have been ambivalent: Living through the last five years of the show, she said, took the edge off any enjoyment I might have had.
0	5	Desi's drinking and carousing were a terrible embarrassment, bad for a woman's self-esteem.
0	5	The talk around town was Lucy.'
0	5	Because I couldn't face people, I became a recluse for more than 5{ years.
0	5	I never demonstrated my unhappiness at the studio, and actually, working together was a blessing.
0	5	Desi had everything so well organized that it was easy to do the work.
0	5	Lucy was late in reaching her comedy potential.
0.607142857142857	5	She was 40 when I Love Lucy started on CBS and revolutionized television.
0	5	And although she spent many years in Hollywood, none of the studios ever designed comedies for me the way MGM did for Red Skelton, Paramount did for Bob Hope and Sam Goldwyn did for Danny Kaye, she once said.
0	5	Television was the medium for me, the medium for anyone who wanted to be well known a lot faster than waiting a year and a half for a movie to come out, she said in an interview late in life.
0	5	Television is an instant barometer, especially the way we did it.
0	5	It was all new.
0.354166666666667	5	Nobody knew anything about television.
0	5	Nobody was there to say, don't do that, it's wrong!'
0	5	We never knew what was wrong and what was right.
0	5	We were all feeling our way.
0	5	Desi was very innovative and very showmanship-conscious and was very intent on going ahead and doing it: sounds all right, let's go!'
0	5	So we went.
0	5	Always the credit to someone else.
0	5	But millions upon millions of television watchers know otherwise.
0.265625	6	As a young girl in western New York, Lucille Ball hawked hot dogs and popcorn at an amusement park as she dreamed of starring in movies, hometown friends recalled.
0	6	She always talked about being a star, said Pauline Lopus, who went to school with Miss Ball and had kept in touch with her.
0.0708333333333333	6	Miss Ball, born 60 miles south of Buffalo in Jamestown on Aug. 6, 1911, grew up in nearby Celoron, a rural hamlet on Chautauqua Lake.
0	6	Mrs. Lopus remembered the sitcom star on Wednesday as daring in many ways.
0	6	She tried to get me to run off Mrs. Lopus added.
0	6	But I didn't have the nerve.
0	6	At 15, Miss Ball worked as a barker at the amusement park, screaming for people to buy popcorn and hot dogs until she lost her voice.
0.141666666666667	6	Later, she starred in high school plays and got her start in front of a large audience on the vaudeville stage at the defunct Palace Theater in Jamestown.
0	6	Although Miss Ball hadn't visited Jamestown since 1956 and had no family there, she stayed in touch with friends.
0	6	Even though she was a big star, she was still just Lucy to us, said Irene Rosseti of Celoron.
0.111842105263158	6	Mrs. Rosseti said Miss Ball recently sent her and her husband a letter on their 50th wedding anniversary.
0	6	Miss Ball regularly donated money to charities, civic events and Jamestown Community College, said Jamestown Mayor Steven Carlson.
0	6	On May 20, Miss Ball was to receive an honorary degree from the college and had planned to return to Jamestown, now a city of about 40,000.
0	6	Residents had put up posters saying Jamestown Loves Lucy in storefronts and home windows.
0.0817307692307692	6	After Miss Ball suffered a heart attack last week, residents decided to sign the posters and send them to her as a get-well greeting.
0	6	More than 150 posters were sent with 10,000 signatures.
0	6	The 77-year-old comedian died Wednesday of a ruptured aorta, the main heart artery, at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, where she was recovering from last week's emergency heart surgery.
0	6	It is a sad day for all of us, said Nelson Garifi, an organizer of the welcoming event.
0	6	But I'm sure that feeling is shared by many people around the world.
0	6	Garifi, community relations director for the community college, said the honorary degree will be awarded posthumously.
0	6	Future generations in Celoron will have a reminder of their famous resident every time they drive or walk down the street where she grew up it will be renamed Lucy Lane.
0	6	Village officials had planned formal ceremonies renaming the street when she was due in the area next month.
0	6	But it will happen anyway, John Goodell of the village's historical society said Wednesday.
0.0544871794871795	6	When the society was formed about a year ago, Goodell said: We sent an invitation to Lucille Ball to be a member, and she sent back a check for $500 for a life membership.
0	6	It was a check written in a very bold hand with a signature about a half inch high.
0.177083333333333	7	An outpouring of sympathy from presidents to childhood neighbors followed the death of Lucille Ball, but many said the queen mother of comedy will live on through television reruns and her influence on comedy.
0	7	The daffy, redheaded comedian whose harebrained schemes drove her television family crazy and delighted viewers for four decades died Wednesday of a ruptured abdominal artery at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center.
0	7	She was 77 and died eight days after emergency heart surgery.
0	7	A private burial was planned, reportedly with no funeral services in accordance with Miss Ball's wishes.
0.17	7	God has her now, and, thanks to television, we'll have her forever, said comedian and longtime friend Bob Hope.
0	7	Hospital switchboards were swamped with condolence calls and thousands of cards after Miss Ball's death, spokesman Ron Wise said.
0	7	Miss Ball's family requested that any flowers sent to the Medical Center in her memory be distributed to other patients.
0	7	Miss Ball maintained her sense of humor even when she was critically ill.
0	7	Following her operation last week, her first words to her daughter, Lucie, were: Wouldn't you know this is the day I was going to get my hair done.
0	7	Miss Ball had been improving steadily from the heart surgery, so her death came as a shock.
0	7	She had been walking, her spirits were up.
0	7	Her family was with her, Wise said.
0	7	She responded as well as anyone could respond to that kind of surgery.
0	7	He said she woke up early Wednesday complaining about a sudden pain in her back, and in a matter of seconds went into a full cardiac arrest that was caused by a ruptured aorta.
0.708333333333333	7	Miss Ball and her late former husband, Desi Arnaz, starred in I Love Lucy from 1951 to 1957.
0.0787037037037037	7	In the ground-breaking show, still seen in syndication worldwide, the late Vivian Vance and William Frawley played their neighbors, Fred and Ethel Mertz.
0	7	Probably a lot of what she did rubbed off on what I do, said actress-comedian Jane Curtin, star of the sitcom Kate and Allie.
0	7	But it couldn't be helped, because I memorized her shows.
0.0708333333333333	7	The show, one of the most popular in television history, was distinguished by Miss Ball's faultless timing, rubber-faced expressions, wide-mouthed wails and extravagant pratfalls.
0	7	Working with Lucy was like receiving an M.A. or a Ph.D. in comedy, recalled Joan Rivers.
0	7	What she forgot about comic timing and delivery is more than most of us will ever learn in a lifetime.
0	7	Comedian Whoopi Goldberg said: Lucy was great because she represented every person.
0	7	She showed us human foibles and gave us a chance to laugh at ourselves.
0.141666666666667	7	Miss Goldberg said her favorite episode involved a visit by the I Love Lucy characters to Hollywood, where Lucy and Ethel spotted actor William Holden in a restaurant.
0.10625	7	That was how we would all react to seeing a movie star in a restaurant, Miss Goldberg said.
0	7	She was looking at him in a compact mirror, and trying to look at him surreptitiously.
0	7	And that's just an example of how everyone can identify with Lucy.
0.208333333333333	7	Bob Rosati, who lives down the street from the Beverly Hills home Miss Ball shared with husband Gary Morton, said he was watching a rerun of I Love Lucy on Wednesday morning when the screen went black and the words In Memory of Lucille Ball, 1911-1989 appeared.
0	7	I felt I had lost someone in my family.
0	7	I couldn't believe it, said Rosati, 40.
0	7	I was watching Lucy like I do every morning.
0	7	She's one of the most-admired ladies in this town.
0	7	He was among a group of fans who stood reverently outside Miss Ball's home on Roxbury Drive as florists delivered baskets of flowers to the house.
0	7	Tour vans passed by in a non-stop procession.
0.0758928571428571	7	On Hollywood Boulevard's Walk of Fame, flower arrangements were placed on Miss Ball's two stars one for her film work, one for television.
0	7	Budd Friedman, owner of the Improvisation comedy clubs, said, The world of comedy has lost its first lady.
0.2125	7	Her death is an irreparable loss to our industry.
0	7	Actor Danny DeVito recalled getting a personal congratulation from Miss Ball in 1981 when he won an Emmy for the TV series Taxi.
0	7	It made it like it had been blessed, he recalled.
0	7	Admirers included President Bush, in Southern California at the time of Miss Ball's passing, and former President Reagan.
0.0625	7	Her red hair, her antics on the screen, her timing and her zest for life made her an American institution, the former president and Nancy Reagan said in a statement.
0	7	Just the mention of her name brings a smile.
0	7	We love Lucy and will miss her deeply.
0.193181818181818	7	Lucille Ball possessed the gift of laughter, Bush said.
0	7	But she also embodied an even greater treasure the gift of love.
0	7	She appealed to the gentler impulses of the human spirit.
0	7	She was not merely an actress or comedienne.
0	7	She was Lucy and she was loved.
0.108974358974359	7	To baby boomers, a happy chunk of our childhood is missing, said Saturday Night Live comedian Victoria Jackson, who was born two years after I Love Lucy went off the air as a regular series.
0	7	She didn't make me laugh out loud, I remember, she just made me happy about life.
0	7	Said comic Tim Conway: We're going to miss this lady, but not really, because she's still here.
0	7	All those wonderful things they did together those wonderful TV shows are still available.
0.0732758620689655	7	Although Miss Ball hadn't visited her hometown of Jamestown, N.Y, since 1956 and had no family there, she had stayed in touch with friends.
0.0732758620689655	7	Irene Rosseti, who now lives in Celoron, N.Y., said Miss Ball recently had sent her and her husband a letter on their 50th wedding anniversary.
0	7	Even though she was a big star, she was still just Lucy to us, she recalled.
0.0544871794871795	7	Hospital spokesman Wise said that the family has asked that donations be sent to the Lucille Ball Foundation, in care of Irella-Manella, 1800 Ave. of the Stars, Suite 900, Los Angeles, Ca. 90067.
0.1875	8	Thousands of Lucille Ball's fans shed tears for the woman who made them laugh, as three cities held memorial services in which the redheaded comedian was remembered with prayers and applause.
0	8	She was a whole package.
0	8	There never will be another one like her.
0	8	I love her, said a tearful Carol Burnett following a memorial Mass in suburban Santa Monica.

0.0923913043478261	8	All three memorial Masses began at 8 p.m. Monday, the time Miss Ball's three most popular programs were often broadcast.

0.159375	8	Miss Ball, known for her honed comedic timing, wide-mouthed expressions and wacky antics, was popular among generations of fans who watched I Love Lucy as a first-run show in the and in three decades of reruns.
0	8	She showed her love in the only way she knew how, by making you laugh, the Rev. James Fox told those gathered for the Roman Catholic Mass at St. Ignatius Loyola in New York.
0	8	Broadcaster Diane Sawyer told the crowd that the death of Miss Ball may have settled a longstanding theological debate over whether there is laughter in heaven.
0	8	A God who would have created her would never let her laughter be far from Him, said Ms. Sawyer.
0.053125	8	In Chicago, the Rev. Jack Wall told people at Old St. Patrick Church that God gave the world talents like Miss Ball to show us life is not a tragedy, but a comedy with a happy ending.
0.118055555555556	8	She taught us that if we could love Lucy, we could love ourselves, Wall said.
0.0758928571428571	8	In announcing the services, Miss Ball's family said: Monday night was the time when most of the nation was used to being with Lucy.
0.085	8	Two of the three long-running comedy shows in which Miss Ball starred, The Lucy Show and Here's Lucy, aired Monday nights.

0.223684210526316	8	Lucille Ball gave the gift of humor which produced happiness, said Schuller at the Santa Monica service.

0.0544871794871795	9	Bob Hope keeps voluminous files, including the jokes he delivered and people he has performed with, and his first entry under Lucille Ball is an appearance with Hope in 1945 on a show called G.I. Journal.
0.157407407407407	9	I really can't remember many details about it, said Hope, who pays tribute to his frequent co-star in an NBC special Saturday night.
0.177083333333333	9	It's called Bob Hope's Love Affair With Lucille Ball.
0.53125	9	She died in April of this year.
0.303571428571429	9	That first time together was followed by four movies, frequent visits by Hope on I Love Lucy and regular appearances by Lucy on his television shows.
0	9	Lucy was a very funny woman, Hope said.
0	9	Even in private she could get off a great ad lib.
0	9	But it's hard to compare her with other funny women.
0	9	It's like asking who's the best golfer.
0	9	You have to go to the records.
0	9	I don't think anyone ever had the success she had.
0	9	She certainly holds the most records.
0	9	A secretary dug the details of that first joint appearance out of one of two vaults where Hope keeps everything pertaining to his long comic career.
0	9	There are written records of all his shows, copies of all the scripts, monologues and comic routines, audio tapes of his radio shows and thousands of other mementos.
0	9	G.I. Journal was on May 4, 1945.
0.141666666666667	9	Hope's file reads: Spot: Lucille Ball English play For Charity Bazaar.
0	9	Hope and Ball had actually known each other before they began working together.
0.375	9	In fact, the late Desi Arnaz, her then husband, worked for Hope first.
0	9	He said Ball asked him nearly 50 years ago to find a place on his popular radio show for band leader Arnaz.
0	9	Stan Kenton was leaving as my orchestra leader, Hope said.
0	9	I gave Desi a spot on my show.
0	9	We also gave him some lines to speak.
0	9	Every time he walked up to the microphone he dropped an enchilada.
0	9	He could hardly talk, let alone get a laugh.
0.326923076923077	9	When they started Love Lucy,' I said, going on?
0	9	This man is funny.'
0	9	The night before she died I performed at the Music Center, he said.
0.085	9	Lucy was in the hospital and I saw her daughter, Lucie Arnaz, and said, it wonderful she's doing better.'
0	9	They called me the next day and said she had died.
0	9	I said, has her now, but we'll have her forever.'
0	9	We'll be watching her performances for a long, long time.
0	9	Bob Hope's Love Affair With Lucy will include clips from their movies and TV appearances, plus such guest stars as Betty White, George Burns and Danny Thomas.
0	9	I'm going through everything myself picking out the clips, Hope said.
0	9	The last time she was on my show was my birthday show two years ago.
0	9	We sang Remember It Well.'
0	9	Our last time together in public was at the Academy Awards in March.
0.118055555555556	9	I think I'll do my tribute to her over a shot of that in the background.
0	9	I think everyone remembers that.
0	9	She was on his radio show on May 27, 1947, at Detroit.
0.25	9	The program notes say, Lucille Ball: New York, clothes, cars, pictures.
0	9	I could do a fashion show with her walking on stage, Hope said of the show clips he had been watching in preparing the special.
0	9	She had great gowns and hairdos.
0	9	When she performed she would use different styles.
0	9	She'd change the way she read a line.
0	9	She'd throw a line away one time, then she'd turn around and milk a line for laughs.
0	9	Hope recalled his funny co-star in a sunny alcove in the living room of his Los Angeles home.
0	9	It overlooks the one-hole golf course in the back yard, and he was attired in golfing clothes.
0	9	Occasionally, he called his office in another building on the grounds to check on a piece of information.
0.10625	9	Soon after the interview, he was aboard a plane for a series of personal appearances around the country.
0	9	Ball made 22 appearances on Hope's specials and he was on her shows 10 or 12 times, he said.

0	9	Ball was a nightclub singer who helps him look after the girl.
0	9	It was a remake of Little Miss Marker, which starred Shirley Temple in 1934.
0	9	Next was Fancy Pants in 1950, a remake of Ruggles of Red Gap.
0	9	Ball played a rich rancher who acquires an English butler, played by Hope.
0.111842105263158	9	Facts of Life was in 1960, with Hope and Ball as married lovers who have a tryst.
0	9	Their last film was Critic's Choice in 1963, in which Hope is a Broadway critic who has to review a play written by his wife, played by Ball.
0	9	Someone reminded me the other night of a bus tour we did of movie theaters in New York to promote one our of pictures, he said.
0	9	I think it was Choice.'
0	9	I found her very cooperative, very wonderful.
0	9	We always had a lot of fun together.

0.111842105263158	11	Miss Ball was a tough-talking woman who had used her stardom and show business savvy to become, with her then-husband, the late Desi Arnaz, head of one of Hollywood's major studios, Desilu.
0.303571428571429	11	Despite her business acumen, she remained the unquestioned queen of television comedy.
0.0505952380952381	11	From her star-struck childhood through her struggles as a wisecracking movie actress in the 1930s and to the television career that made her a legend, Miss Ball's life was in the best show business tradition of rags to riches.
0	11	Almost humbly, she liked to say she owed her enormous success, not so much to talent, but to a magical combination of guts and good supporting players.
0.0559210526315789	11	Her greatest achievements, she always would add, were not any milestones in her career but ranked somewhere under the birth of her two children, Lucie in 1951 and Desi Jr., two years later.

0.245192307692308	11	It was Love Lucy," which premiered on CBS on Oct. 15, 1951, that earned Miss Ball her niche in television history.
0	11	The 30-minute comedy starred Miss Ball and the Cuban-born Arnaz as the wacky Lucy Ricardo and her conga-playing husband Ricky.
0	11	The show was a weekly dash into absurdity that boasted the biggest television audience of its time of almost any time.
0.708333333333333	11	Stopped the Nation
0.151785714285714	11	In creating the show, Miss Ball and Arnaz who died in 1986 set a pattern of television that was to be repeated in decades to come.
0.184782608695652	11	They filmed the programs in front of a live audience and in doing so, invented the popular and financially rewarding rerun.
0.0923913043478261	11	The show was so popular during the 1950s that it literally stopped the nation every Monday night from 9 p.m. to 9:30 p.m.
0.0988372093023256	11	In fact, nighttime shoppers became so scarce in Chicago that the mammoth Marshall Field department store posted a sign that read: Love Lucy, too, so from now on we will be open Thursday night instead of Monday."
0	11	When presidential candidate Adlai E. Stevenson interrupted the show once for a political message, he was flooded with angry mail.
0	11	Even a charge that Miss Ball was a Communist, made by the House Un-American Activities Committee in 1952, failed to dent her popularity.
0	11	The charges, based on her registering to vote as a Communist in 1936, were dropped when Miss Ball explained she had done so only to please her ailing grandfather.
0	11	Millions of sympathetic fans and a pragmatic CBS understood.
0	11	A phenomenal 40 million viewers watched the antics each week as Lucy would always try to outwit Ricky.
0	11	With their best friends and landlords, Fred and Ethel Mertz, played by veterans William Frawley and Vivian Vance as the perfect foils, the Ricardos found themselves mired in situations that frequently were rowdy and always ridiculous.
0	11	A generation of Americans grew to recap their favorite Lucy episodes, plot twist by crazy twist.
0.0607142857142857	11	There was the time Lucy schemed her way onto Ricky's television show to do a commercial for a vegetable drink with a high alcoholic content and got hilariously tipsy during the many retakes.
0	11	Then there was the time she threw in two packages of yeast while baking homemade bread and ended up pinned against the wall of her Manhattan kitchen by a monster loaf.
0	11	And there was the time Lucy and Ethel, trying to impress their New York friends with the ultimate souvenir from a trip to Hollywood, pried loose the cement block containing John Wayne's footprints from in front of Grauman's Chinese Theater.
0	11	Of course, the block broke.
0	11	Week after week, Lucy would find herself trapped in a vat of laundry starch, locked in a meat freezer, or lost on a subway with a loving cup stuck on her head.
0	11	Her turmoils permanently positioned her in the hearts of most Americans, including the critics.
0.0885416666666667	11	extraordinary discipline and intuitive understanding of farce give Love Lucy' an engaging lilt," wrote New York Times critic Jack Gould.
0	11	In its Lucy cover story, Time magazine said: is the sort of cheerful rowdiness that has been rare. Lucille submits enthusiastically to being hit with pies; falls over furniture. Tricked out as a ballerina or a Hindu maharani or a toothless hillbilly, she takes her assorted lumps and pratfalls with unflagging zest and good humor."
0	11	In a 1981 interview in The Times, even Miss Ball admitted, love Lucy."
0	11	were two key qualities to her," the comedienne said.
0	11	was always in financial trouble if she wanted a fur collar, a ratty little fur collar, she had to figure out a way to make some extra money to get it. God, that's universal.
0	11	And she always had a domineering figure over her. Lucy was forever knocking somebody's top hat off."
0.1328125	11	Miss Ball's personal favorite episodes were filmed when she was pregnant with Desi Jr.
0.0625	11	An amazing 44 million viewers, 90% of the television audience, gleefully watched on Jan. 19, 1953, when she gave birth on film to the show's little Ricky.
0	11	To the unabashed delight of a nation, it was the same night she had given birth in real life.
0	11	was so damned happy just floating on a cloud and I think the way I felt came across on the film," she said.
0	11	loved doing all those pregnant shows."
0	11	Astoundingly, or so it seems in retrospect, early reviews of Miss Ball's talents gave little hint of what was to come.
0	11	In fact, when she was a plucky 15-year-old looking for that first break on Broadway, Miss Ball was told by a drama teacher to give up.
0	11	Luckily, the turquoise-eyed teen-ager ignored the advice.
0	11	Born to an electrician father and pianist mother on Aug. 6, 1911, in a suburb of Jamestown, N.Y., Miss Ball had set her sights on stardom almost from the first.
0	11	By 5, the brown-haired little girl was taking music lessons.
0	11	Each spring that followed she would head toward New York City, walking until someone found her and returned her to her home.
0	11	Leaving school at 15, Miss Ball finally made it to New York and the John Murray Anderson dramatic school.
0	11	There was a brief stint in a Ziegfeld Follies road show and some short-lived appearances in a handful of Broadway chorus lines.
0	11	Changing her name to Diane Belmont she turned to modeling.
0.128787878787879	11	At various times a dress model and a hat model, Miss Ball, with long legs peeking out the bottom of a oversized cigarette pack, ultimately became a girl."
0	11	America grew to know her on billboards, magazine ads and on posters in its drugstore windows.
0	11	Then in 1933, she headed to Hollywood.
0	11	Her curly hair bleached a Jean Harlow platinum, Miss Ball was hired to work for six weeks in the chorus of Samuel Goldwyn's Scandals."
0	11	Bit part after bit part stretched her stay to six months and she became a Hollywood fixture, taking second billing in the years that followed to everyone from The Three Stooges and Buster Keaton to Katharine Hepburn and Spencer Tracy.
0	11	Along the way, she dyed her hair a fiery red and was given the unofficial title of of the Bs."
0	11	Reviewers noted her presence" and talent for slapstick clowning."
0	11	She was described in one newspaper as a breezy wisecracking gal with a bebop rhythm to her walk."
0.265625	11	Said another, Lucille Ball was born for the parts Ginger Rogers sweats over."
0.163461538461538	11	Playing the ingenue lead in the 1940 musical Many Girls," Miss Ball met rumba singer Arnaz, cast as a Cuban football player.
0	11	She later told an interviewer, was, at least for me, true love from the start."
0	11	Exchanging vows seven months later, the pair began what was for the most part a troubled marriage.
0	11	All but three of their first 11 years of marriage were spent apart.
0.0708333333333333	11	With Arnaz traveling the country with his band and Miss Ball committed to Hollywood sound stages, the pair spent almost $30,000 on telegrams and long-distance telephone calls.
0	11	would end up talking on the phone no, fighting on the phone," Miss Ball told interviewers.
0	11	can't have a marriage over the phone.
0	11	You can't have children over the phone.
0	11	It became obvious that something had to be done."
0.177083333333333	11	What was done to salvage the marriage was Love Lucy."
0.0518292682926829	11	Since CBS was stubbornly opposed to the idea of the heavily accented Arnaz playing the husband, the determined Arnazes created their own Desilu company and took a stage version of their show on the road to gauge public opinion.
0.375	11	It was a smash, and television executives reluctantly gave Love Lucy" a time slot.
0	11	wanted our characters to have problems," Miss Ball said of her concept for the show.
0	11	wanted to be an average housewife.
0	11	A very nosy but very average housewife.
0	11	And I wanted my husband to love me.
0	11	thought we were out of our minds to want to do it on film."
0.293103448275862	11	The episodes were filmed before a live audience by Academy Award-winning cinematographer Karl Freund, famous for his work on such films as Good Earth" and Garbo's
0	11	When the Arnazes negotiated to keep the films show our kids someday," few in the industry predicted what would happen.
0	11	remember saying, films may be worth something someday,' Miss Ball told The Times.
0	11	should hang onto them.
0	11	If Desi had that in mind, I never knew it.
0	11	Maybe he knew he was creating the rerun but he never told me about it.
0	11	All I knew was I was 40 years old and was having my first baby and I didn't want to do these shows and let them disappear into the air.
0	11	I felt we could save the films for home movies.
0.103658536585366	11	Instead, in the years since the original 153 Love Lucy" episodes were telecast, they have been shown and reshown in virtually every country around the globe, earning an estimated $50 million to $100 million.
0	11	Miss Ball's face was one of the most recognized on Earth.
0	11	But all of it was not enough to save her troubled marriage.
0.375	11	To the horror of their television fans, Miss Ball and Arnaz were divorced in 1960.
0	11	was like Jekyll and Hyde," she said years later.
0	11	drank and he gambled and he went around with other women.
0	11	It was always the same: booze and broads."
0	11	Breaking with the past, Miss Ball left Hollywood for New York and a starring role in the musical
0	11	The 1960 production floundered after only a few performances but during her stay in the East, she met stand-up comedian Gary Morton.
0	11	They married in 1961.
0.101190476190476	11	Meanwhile, Arnaz and Miss Ball had sold their Love Lucy" films to CBS for $6 million and she bought her ex-husband's interest in Desilu, becoming in effect, the first woman to head a major studio.
0	11	It was by then home to 18 shows, including such hits as Untouchables" and Ann Sothern Show."
0	11	Friend Bob Hope called her business sense
0	11	never wanted to be an executive, but when my marriage to Desi broke up after 19 years, I couldn't just walk away from my obligations and say it,' Miss Ball explained.
0	11	were an institution.
0	11	Life takes guts.
0	11	If you don't take chances, you'll never bathe again because you might get dirty again."
0	11	Husband Morton said Miss Ball was blessed with an business sense."
0	11	she was running Desilu," he said, made decisions affecting the future of the company that often amazed board members, not because they were coming from a woman but because time usually proved her judgment to be correct."
0	11	Among the shows Miss Ball tutored to success was her own Lucy Show," a series without Arnaz but with the same madcap clowning that kept her fans delighted.
0	11	Among the guest stars attracted by the madness were Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton, the most glittering couple of the day.
0.0643939393939394	11	In 1967, with Desilu churning out a gold mine of televisions hits, Trek" and Impossible" among them, an exhausted Miss Ball decided that she had had enough.
0	11	Gulf Western Industries bought the property for a reported $17 million.
0.172297297297297	11	In place of Desilu, Miss Ball, along with Morton, launched the much smaller Lucille Ball Productions Inc. and in 1968, began filming Lucy," a series featuring Desi Jr. and Lucie.
0	11	life started when my children were born," Miss Ball said at the time.
0	11	couldn't wait to work with them. Even when they moved out of the house, they were still home at the studio.
0	11	I liked that."
0	11	The series aired through 1974.
0	11	With her children's careers off the launching pad, the comedienne, then 63, decided it was time to retire her legendary character.
0	11	Lucy character is too old to run around like an idiot," she said in explanation.
0	11	That same year, she filmed her final motion picture, a version of the Broadway musical.
0	11	Although by now the world's best-known television star, as a movie star Miss Ball again received mixed reviews.
0	11	Times critic Charles Champlin wrote, shame about is that it managed to deny us a Lucy to love."
0	11	With those final starring credits to her name, she settled into co-producing shows, making occasional television appearances and accepting one after another of a continual barrage of awards and tributes.
0.0787037037037037	11	In addition to her 13 Emmy nominations Miss Ball was feted in 1976 with a nostalgic television tribute saluting the 25th anniversary of Love Lucy."
0	11	Danny Kaye was among those who gave testimonials during the two hours of reminiscing.
0.118055555555556	11	Lucille Ball just a comedienne is like calling Margot Fonteyn just a dancer," Kaye said.
0.0607142857142857	11	In 1984, when she was named one of seven initial inductees in the Television Hall of Fame, she credited the many and creative people" around her for making her a legend.
0	11	have been absolutely blessed," Miss Ball said.
0	11	Role as Bag Lady
0	11	The following year she took on one of the most challenging roles of her career: a bag lady in the television movie Pillow."
0	11	She was hospitalized for dehydration when it was over, but it was a critical and ratings success.
0.0732758620689655	11	Her last flirtation with television came with her ill-fated and short-lived 1986 series, With Lucy," in which she again teamed with longtime sidekick Gale Gordon.
0	11	It was quickly pulled by the network because of abysmal ratings.
0	11	Her final public appearance proved to be during the 61st annual Academy Awards ceremony on March 29 when she joined her old friend Hope as a presenter.
0	11	She had signed a contract with Putnam to publish her autobiography but died before she could begin work on it.
0.0787037037037037	11	Tearfully sentimental when it came to her husband and family, she reveled in life as a grandmother and glowed whenever she talked of her children.
0	11	Their struggles and early failed marriages seemed not to matter.
0.101190476190476	11	While she always spoke fondly of Arnaz, Miss Ball claimed that she had found the perfect mate in Morton.
0	11	takes care of me like I was his mother," she told an interviewer in 1981.
0	11	gives me protection."
0	11	On a scale of 1 to 10, Miss Ball said, rate my marriage to Gary a 12."
0.0559210526315789	11	But to her countless television fans from the postwar babies who adored her during the to their children and children's children who roared at her antics through decades of reruns it was always Lucy and Ricky.
0	11	More than a quarter-century of marriage to Morton could not erase that.
0	11	There was always the hilarious image of the redhead and Cuban bongo player," as Miss Ball affectionately called him.
0	11	Even years after the Lucy shows ended, the comedienne openly admitted to missing the characterization.
0	11	Lucy ended, I thought, live a few more years and then I'll die," she said in 1983.

0.364285714285714	13	Lucille Ball, whose death Wednesday morning at the age of 77 will be the most widely and deeply felt show-business loss in recent memory, was the movies' greatest gift to television.
0	13	It turned out to be one of Sam Goldwyn's finest and most prophetic hours when he signed her as one of his Goldwyn Girls to appear in Scandals" with Eddie Cantor in 1933.
0	13	She had had bit parts in two earlier films but Scandals" was the one that gave her a firmer foothold on the slippery slopes of a Hollywood career.
0.303571428571429	13	The movies prepared her for television.
0	13	She perfected her matchless craft as a comedienne in dozens of films, including three of Fred Astaire's and one of the Marx Brothers
0	13	A lot of the other films caused few ripples on the wide surface of film history.
0	13	But in those years Lucy was refining her enduring, endearing public image as a perky, saucy woman who was likelier to end up with the hero's funny pal than with the hero himself.
0.0559210526315789	13	Yet as often happened with supporting performers, her verve, an engagingly sharp tongue and a rather salty view of the world made her more interesting than the square-cut principals, and led to leading roles.
0.157407407407407	13	To look at the Love Lucy" reruns today, as everybody does, again and again, is to realize how superbly professional they are.
0.303571428571429	13	Today many sitcoms still use the three-camera technique, shooting in front of live audiences, that Desi Arnaz pioneered.
0	13	The idea now seems as inevitable as the wheel or pre-sliced muffins, and yet you wonder if it would have worked nearly as well or caught on at all without Lucy's sheer expertise as a physical as well as a verbal comedienne.
0.0590277777777778	13	She made it all even the wildest, craziest capers look as if it were happening now spontaneous, unrehearsed, accidental, the inevitable consequences of the screen Lucy's scatterbrained and lovable personality.
0	13	Her foils Desi himself, Vivian Vance and William Frawley were superb farceurs themselves, but Lucy was the dynamo that made it all work.
0	13	The craft was invisible, the skills so perfected they concealed themselves totally.
0	13	It was a brilliant illusion, generating a charm that hid the hard work and the artful writing and editing as well as the performing.
0.6375	13	The result was probably the finest and certainly the most durable single series in television's history thus far.
0	13	The appeal of the Lucy shows was also the most universal that American television has yet provided.
0	13	They were wholly, prototypically American, and that is central to their popularity abroad.
0	13	Yet they have been embraced as the kind of middle-class goings-on that might possibly arise almost anywhere there is a middle class.
0	13	Lucy was all-American but, equally, a citizen of the world.
0.146551724137931	13	Her successful career in films, in which she ultimately earned star billing if not superstar status, gave her an invaluable identification when Love Lucy" began.
0.141666666666667	13	The irony is that, created by the movies, she was to achieve fame and fortune in television on a scale that had eluded her in the movies.
0.101190476190476	13	Indeed, when Lucy began to commandeer our hearts on Love Lucy" in 1951, the movies were already in considerable trouble, their audiences staying home in large numbers to watch the likes of Lucy in their living rooms.
0	13	As always, her timing was impeccable.
0.472222222222222	13	Lucille Ball was not Lucy, of course.
0	13	She had come a hard road from Jamestown, N.Y., in a line of work in which you did not survive by being scatterbrained.
0	13	She was smart, hard-working and a perfectionist who knew that whatever else it was, comedy was not accidental.
0.0425	13	Then again, the cameras, television or film, have X-ray properties, and the millions who saw and loved her were not wrong to think they perceived a generous and loving woman, as well as a glorious clown who knew the world was better off laughing.

0.3	0	The earthquake that devastated Iran early Thursday took tens of thousands of lives because people were asleep in fragile homes built on flood plains, an earthquake expert said.
0.0454545454545455	0	Most casualties from earthquakes are caused by something falling on top of you, said Russ Needham, a geophysist with the U.S. Geological Survey that monitors ground motion around the world.
0.145161290322581	0	The quake hit at 12:30 a.m. in Iran, when most of the people were in their homes, Needham said Thursday in a telephone interview from Golden, Colo.
0.0882352941176471	0	At least 25,000 people died and thousands were injured in the quake, which demolished scores of villages and buried thousands of people in the rubble of their homes, Iranian officials said.
0	0	Needham said most structures in that area are built of a ceramic-type brick or adobe that collapses easily.
0.0555555555555556	0	It's very similar to what we had in Armenia, he said of the Dec. 7, 1988, earthquake that killed about 25,000 people.
0.1875	0	A Soviet parliamentary report later blamed the high number of fatalities on shoddily built buildings.
0.12	0	The Armenian quake was measured at 6.9 on the Richter scale, but Thursday's earthquake shook the earth with a magnitude of 7.7.
0.1875	0	The shock wave traveled through the mountainous section of coastal Iran where most of the buildings are built on a flood plain of loosely deposited soil that shifts in an earthquake and allows structures to collapse, he said.
0	0	The 7.7-magnitude quake was the largest ever recorded in that area, where two major plates of the earth's crust meet, Needhams said.
0.0714285714285714	0	Iran is in a very active seismic region, he said, and that there have been many smaller quakes.
0	0	Twelve earthquakes greater than magnitude 7 have occurred in Iran during the last 30 years, Needhams said.
0.0714285714285714	0	A quake of magnitude 7 is considered a major earthquake, capable of widespread, heavy damage in populated areas.

0.0714285714285714	1	Like Thursday's earthquake in Iran, the Dec. 7, 1988, earthquake in Armenia killed about 25,000 people.
0.136363636363636	1	Most died in structures that collapsed when the quake hit.
0.130434782608696	1	It's very similar to what we had in Armenia, said Russ Needham, a geophysicist with the U.S. Geological Survey.
0.145161290322581	1	The Armenian quake was measured at 6.9 on the Richter scale, but Thursday's earthquake shook the earth with a magnitude of 7.7 according to the U.S. Geological Survey.
0.107142857142857	1	In the Iranian quake, the casualty count was pushed up by the fact that people were indoors and asleep at the time, just after midnight.
0	1	Many of the victims lived in fragile homes built of a ceramic-type brick or adobe that collapses easily.
0.142857142857143	1	In the Armenian quake, a Soviet parliamentary report later blamed the high number of fatalities on shoddily built buildings.

0.0857142857142857	2	Iran is deliberately underreporting the number of casualties from Thursday's massive earthquake out of fear of a political backlash, leaders of a group seeking to overthrow the country's Islamic leadership say.
0	2	The regime is very much fearful of public outrage, said Shahin Gobadi, spokesman for the People's Mojahedin of Iran.
0	2	They're very much afraid of the political aftershocks.

0.111111111111111	2	Iran has told the United Nations that the death toll is at least 36,000, but Gobadi said his organization has received estimates closer to 100,000.
0	2	Gobadi said the country cannot properly assist earthquake victims because its treasury has been spent in a war with neighboring Iraq and against internal opposition.
0	2	They have been very late in assisting the people, he said.
0.0576923076923077	2	Sympathy for the earthquake victims was a secondary issue for the chanting, flag-waving rally participants, who also carried signs criticizing their native country.
0.12	2	Planning for the event began three weeks before the earthquake, but part of the Friday's activities focused on Iran's stricken residents.
0	2	Gobadi said shoddy housing in which the government forced people to live was the cause for the widespread loss of life.
0	2	This regime has brought them nothing but devastation and misery.
0	2	This regime has devoted all of its resources to a senseless war with Iraq and to oppression of the people at home, he said.
0	2	A U.N.-sponsored cease-fire was declared last year after eight years of the Iran-Iraq war.
0.181818181818182	2	Iran's Islamic republic was established in 1979 after Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi was deposed by Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini and militants seized the U.S. Embassy in Tehran, taking 66 Americans hostage.
0.375	2	The United States broke diplomatic relations with Iran in April 1980.
0	2	The shah died in exile in July 1980, U.S. hostages were freed six months later and Khomeini died last June.
0	2	Gobadi said his 25-year-old group had helped depose the shah but had no part in organizing the Islamic republic.
0.046875	2	Even in this tragedy for which we grieve we cannot trust the regime in Iran, Rep. Mervyn Dymally, D-Calif., told an estimated 3,000 people attending the rally.
0.0967741935483871	2	There were many, many victims before this tragedy and there are victims now whose needs need to be addressed by the people of the United States, he said.
0.0428571428571429	2	Dymally, a member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, praised President Bush's offer of humanitarian aid to Iran but said Bush must make sure the assistance is channeled through non-government groups.

0.0441176470588235	4	The criminal role of America in Iran's past became evident once again in the recent earthquake, the Jomhuri Islami said in an editorial reported by the official Islamic Republic News Agency.
0.0833333333333333	4	Our people, even under the rubble, chant to America' and pray to God to cut off the hands of the United States even those hands stretched out to help, it said.

0.0967741935483871	4	Even after its expulsion from Iran, the U.S. government by imposing economic sanctions and launching several other plots, halted the renovation of the country, the editorial added.
0.136363636363636	4	The newspaper was implying that with these actions the United States had blocked the diversion of funds to earthquake safety measures.
0.145161290322581	4	If the United States has real humanitarian objectives and intended to help the Iranian nation, it should do only one thing, stop hatching plots, the newspaper said.

0.075	6	There have been only rare instances of U.S.-Iranian cooperation since the two countries broke diplomatic relations a decade ago.

0	6	Offers of help came from across the globe.
0.0909090909090909	6	The death toll was higher than a quake that killed 25,000 people in nearby Soviet Armenia in December, 1988, and a quake in Iran in 1978 that also killed 25,000.

0.12962962962963	0	Mikhail S. Gorbachev on Friday proposed tougher legislation to punish Soviets who seek to kindle ethnic unrest, saying nationalist passions benefit opponents of his reforms.
0.189189189189189	0	The Soviet leader told a meeting of the Communist Party leadership that inter-ethnic relations were worsening in some regions of the country, due in part to active resistance put up to perestroika by corrupt groups.
0	0	Perestroika, or restructuring, is Gorbachev's program for widespread economic and social change.

0.25	0	A summary of his remarks was distributed by the official Tass news agency.
0.875	0	Gorbachev outlined the reasons for a current aggravation of tensions between ethnic groups in some regions of the Soviet Union, Tass said.
0.228260869565217	0	Among the causes, Gorbachev listed a lack of concern for many years for the specific requirements of peoples and ethnic groups, inadequate control by the masses over the activities of executive personnel, and active resistance put up to perestroika by corrupt groups.
0	0	Tass said that after Gorbachev noted that nationalist passions benefit all anti-perestroika forces, he suggested increasing accountability in Soviet laws for kindling ethnic strife.
0	0	Tass did not give details of Gorbachev's suggestion.
0.14	0	At the July 18 Presidium meeting, the Soviet leader accused corrupt conservatives who oppose his reforms of hiding behind the Nagorno-Karabakh annexation drive.
0	0	Gorbachev said the grounds for tougher legislation come directly from Article 36 of the 1977 Soviet Constitution, which says the law can punish any advocacy of racial or national exclusiveness, hostility or contempt.
0.254545454545455	0	Tass said Gorbachev made other proposals on how to resolve ethnic tensions, including an increase in power for each of the country's 15 republics, a law on equal use of the more than 100 languages spoken in the Soviet Union and some economic autonomy for the country's republics and regions.

0	1	The government has decided to give ethnic Germans and Crimean Tatars who were expelled from their homelands by Josef Stalin their own autonomous regions but it will take years, Tass reported Wednesday.
0	1	The ice has been broken.
0	1	A start has been made.
0.116666666666667	1	We're working on creating such autonomy, said Rafik Nishanov, chairman of a chamber of the Soviet legislature, in remarks carried by the official news agency.
0	1	However, he said, the nuts and bolts of how to create the regions still had to be worked out.
0	1	For example, a 10-year program on resettlement.
0	1	People can't just be expelled from the area for others to move in.
0.0777777777777778	1	The Tatars of the Crimea and the ethnic Germans who lived on the Volga River were forcibly resettled during World War II, when Josef Stalin kicked peoples out of their homelands on the grounds they could not be trusted to occupy strategic areas.
0.0795454545454546	1	The Tatars and Germans, among others, long have been agitating to return from Siberia and Central Asia to their traditional lands, and last month the Supreme Soviet legislature declared that all peoples exiled under Stalin should be considered politically rehabilitated.
0	1	But other people now occupy the lands and houses that belonged to the exiles, and re-establishing their dominion in their home regions will not be so simple.
0.0972222222222222	1	The Supreme Soviet took the basic decision that the two autonmous regions should be created on Nov. 28 but kept it quiet, apparently fearing explosive reactions from the populations now living in the regions.
0.583333333333333	1	It was also a potentially dangerous precedent: The Soviet Union is a patchwork of well over 100 ethnic groups, and many of them have outstanding territorial claims.
0	1	Trouble already has been reported between ethnic Germans and Russians in several cities on the Volga.
0	1	Residents of the Saratov and Volgograd regions have protested the prospect of seeing many of the nation's estimated 2 million Germans descending on them.
0.35	1	Ethnographers estimate there are some 500,000 Crimean Tatars in the Soviet Union, and another 1 million in Turkey.
0.109375	1	Their protests near the Kremlin in 1987 demanding to be allowed to return to their homeland were among the first tests of President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's promises of greater democracy.
0	1	Several thousand Tatars have been filtering back to the Crimea each year despite the lack of wholesale permission to return.
0.0760869565217391	1	A wave of some 100,000 ethnic Germans emigrated to West Germany this year, but many would probably stay if they could be assured of their own republic, said Irina Ostroukh, a researcher at the Soviet Institute of Ethnography who studies ethnic Germans.
0.116666666666667	1	The Nov. 28 plan approved by the Supreme Soviet recommended excluding from the German region areas where resistance to German resettlement was strongest in order to avoid ethnic conflicts.
0.25	1	The explosive conflict between Armenians and Azerbaijanis over the Nagorno-Karabakh region has led to 200 deaths and hundreds of thousands of refugees in the last two years.
0	1	Both sides claim control over the mountainous enclave.
0	1	The Supreme Soviet charged the government with creating a commmission to determine how to create the regions for the Germans and Crimean Tatars.
0.403846153846154	2	Ethnic violence killed 148 people and wounded 885 this month in the Central Asian republic of Kirghizia, the official news agency Tass said Wednesday.

0	2	No new outbreaks were reported in the region near the border city of Osh in western Kirghizia, where clashes arising from a land dispute began on June 2 between ethnic Kirghiz and Uzbeks, both Sunni Moslems.
0.21875	2	The argument involves allocation of land in a densly populated region where housing is scarce.
0	2	It was the latest in a series of bloody civil conflicts to trouble President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's government.
0.283783783783784	2	Maj. Gen. Alexander Grienko, chief of the Interior Ministry's Political Department, said that in two years of civil strife mainly ethnic clashes in the Soviet Union, about 24,000 people have been arrested.
0.375	2	He said in Moscow on Tuesday that ministry troops had to be used in 13 regions of the Soviet Union because of such outbreaks, Tass said.
0.194444444444444	2	Grienko said 16 ministry soldiers were killed, four were reported missing and more than 1,000 wounded.
0	2	Tass did not quote Grienko on how civilians casualties.
0.338709677419355	2	The general was quoted as saying these conflicts were often accompanied by riots and pogroms, arson and massacre of innocent people, complete or partial destabilization of the situation.
0.844827586206897	2	Besides unrest this month in Kirghizia and Uzbekistan, ethnic violence also has been reported in recent years in Georgia, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan and Tadzhikistan.
0.680555555555556	3	Moldavia, acting to defuse one of the Soviet Union's most explosive ethnic conflicts, agreed Sunday to comply with a Kremlin order to reconsider its law making Moldavian the republic's official language.
0.12962962962963	3	The republic's parliament acted in response to a decree issued on Dec. 22 by President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the official news agency Tass reported.
0.116666666666667	3	Gorbachev also gave the republic 10 days to dissolve a new national guard and to come up with measures guaranteeing equal rights for all ethnic groups within its borders.
0	3	Tass said the Moldavan parliament agreed to disband the nationalguard and to revise a law that Gorbachev said restricted the rights of minorities.
0.56	3	Ethnic tension has gripped Moldavia, a largely agricultural republic bordering Romania, during its push for independence from the Soviet Union this year.
0	3	The unrest turned violent last month, when government troops clashed with activists, leaving four dead.
0	3	Gorbachev said the conflicts had reached critical levels, and he put part of the blame on the Moldavian Supreme Soviet for enacting laws that discriminate against minorities.
0.175	3	Alarmed by rising Moldavian nationalism, two of the republic's minority groups have begun their own separatist movements.
0	3	The Gagauz, a group of about 150,000 Turkish Christians, declared a new republic in southern Moldavia.
0.134615384615385	3	In the eastern part of Moldavia, more than 300,000 ethnic Russians and Ukrainians have joined in declaring a new republic along the Dneister River.
0	3	All three groups claim discrimination by Moldavians.
0.212121212121212	3	In particular, they resent a new law making Moldavian the official language and requiring people in dozens of jobs ranging from doctors to hairdressers to pass Moldavian language tests by 1995.
0	3	Tass did not say how the Moldavian parliament would modify the law.
0.205882352941176	3	Moldavian is identical to Romanian except for the Cyrillic script Josef Stalin imposed on the republic.
0	3	It is spoken by two-thirds of the republic's residents.
0	3	Soviet hard-liners want Gorbachev to impose a state of emergency and presidential rule in troubled zones throughout the ethnically and geographically diverse country.
0	3	Gorbachev said the declaration of the Gagauz and Dniester republics was illegal under the Soviet and Moldavian constitutions, as were elections to form legislatures and any actions by those bodies.
0	3	The Moldavian legislature has also voted to declare the elections null and void.
0.0875	3	After residents of the Gagauz region began holding local elections in late October, the Moldavian legislature clamped a two-month state of emergency on the region, restricting movement in and out of the area and banning public rallies.
0	3	Volunteer brigades of college-age Moldavians, who then flocked to the region to try to stop the separatist movement, were ordered dissolved by Gorbachev's decree.
0	3	The volunteers were organized by nationalist groups, including the Moldavian People's Front.
0	4	BFN Viktor Alksnis, former USSR Supreme Soviet deputy, today reminded us of his existence.
0.0897435897435897	4	Irina Zaytseva] Viktor Alksnis, born 1950, Latvian, former deputy of the Supreme Soviet of the former USSR, soldier, resigned from the Army in order to fight for the restoration of the USSR.
0	4	During the October events he left the White House with a head wound and was taken to hospital.
0	4	After a long interval Viktor Alksnis held a news conference today in the Slavjanskaya Hotel.
0.0660377358490566	4	He began it with a short statement, the essence of which comes down to the fact that the adoption of the Latvian citizenship law violates not only human rights, but creates the conditions for a conflict similar, in his opinion, to the ones in Yugoslavia and the Caucasus.
0	4	It was not only the Latvian Government Alksnis accused of this, but also the United States.
0	4	According to him, during the latest visit to the United States by President] Guntis Ulmanis, sanction was obtained for the adoption of the aforementioned discriminatory law.
0.159090909090909	4	Alksnis recording] And thus carte blanche was given for mild ethnic cleansing of the Russian speaking population of the republic.
0.134615384615385	4	recording] Apart from that, Alksnis added, according to information received from reliable sources, certain circles in Moscow want conflict in Latvia.
0	4	Alksnis recording] A certain scenario exists to drive a so-called security corridor along the route Daugavpils-Yekabpils-Riga where stringent ethnic cleansing of the Latvian population will take place in reply to the mild ethnic cleansing of the Russian population in order to bring so-called independent Latvia to its knees.
0	4	recording] Journalists asked for more precise information about what Alksnis called reliable sources.
0	4	Alksnis recording] You understand that I cannot name these sources.
0	4	But I can say that they are fairly authoritative.
0	4	recording] Asked what he intends to do, Alksnis said his opportunities are unfortunately limited, and that is why he is appealing to journalists.
0	4	In his opinion, only joint efforts can bring this information to the attention of world public opinion, point out the seriousness of this issue, and avoid the coming tragedy.
0.276315789473684	5	Tajik communists' leader Shodiy Shabdolov told ITAR-TASS on Monday May]that the disintegration of the Soviet Union and the parade of sovereignty that followed it have led to economic and political chaos in all republics.
0.102941176470588	5	Radical market reforms by quasi- democrats" and privatisation" have enriched a small group of nouveau riches and plunged the rest of the population in poverty and hunger, he said.
0.525	5	The mass drive for sovereignty was accompanied by armed inter-ethnic conflicts in many ex-Soviet republics and outburst of nationalism.
0	5	Tajikistan was hit most hard.
0	5	The civil war in the Republic claimed the lives of more than 100,000 people, Shabdolov said.
1	5	He noted that the majority of the population support Tajik communists' call for the restoration of the Soviet Union.
0.0921052631578947	5	Over one million people, about two-thirds of the adult population, signed appeals unity, brotherhood and friendship of the peoples of the USSR" adopted by numerous conferences and meetings held all across the Republic.
0	5	Supporters of the restoration of a renovated union held a founding congress of their movement in Dushanbe on Saturday.
0.109375	5	Apart from the communist party, the founders of the new movement include Tajik trade unions, the Union of Tajik Women, organisations of veterans and ethnic and cultural associations.
0	5	are confident that our movement is growing so strong that it cannot be stopped," Shabdolov said.
0	5	He stressed that it will act within the framework of the law and use only constitutional methods.

0.109375	6	A CEASEFIRE in Moldova was threatened yesterday when a truck driver transporting militiamen was shot dead by machinegun fire in the self-proclaimed Trans Dnestr republic, home of the Russian-speaking minority.
0	6	The shooting came shortly after the ceasefire came into effect between the Moldovan authorities, dominated by ethnic Romanians, and the minority based in the republic on the east bank of the river Dnestr.
0.5	6	At least nine people have been killed in clashes over the past week.
0.159090909090909	6	As in the more severe conflict in Nagorno-Karabakh, the underlying tensions are growing and neither side believes it is losing.
0.518518518518518	6	In other respects, however, the conflicts are quite different and illustrate the complexity of conflict with which the former Soviet Union is now faced.
0.25	6	The Trans Dnestr conflict stems directly from the breakup of the Soviet Union while Nagorno-Karabakh has been a source of tension between Azeris and Armenians for centuries.
0.318181818181818	6	Moldova was finally taken under full Soviet control in 1944.
0	6	The Soviet leadership sought to stifle any attempts to preserve its former links with Romania calling Moldovan a separate language from Romanian, and constructing a separate history for the Moldovan people.
0	6	Industry was largely situated on the left bank of the Dnestr, in the sliver of the republic next to Ukraine, and largely staffed by Russians and Ukrainians.
0.166666666666667	6	Ukrainians and Russians together represent some 27 per cent of the population, with Moldovans accounting for 64 per cent.
0	6	The little republic was slow to respond to the stirrings of reform.
0	6	When it did, in 1989, a language movement quickly put the hardline Communist Party on the defensive and it lost power in 1990 to the present nationalist government, headed by President Mircea Snegur, the former secretary of the Moldovan Party's central committee.
0.152173913043478	6	From the beginning of the nationalist movement, it was clear that the Russian and, to a lesser extent, the Ukrainian minorities would be hostile, reacting to laws establishing Moldovan as the official language and to calls for renewed union with Romania with strikes and demonstrations, and, finally last year, proclaiming Trans Dnestr independent under a Russian president, Mr Igor Smirnov.
0.1	6	During the August coup last year, the Moldovan government stoutly rejected it and the Trans Dnestr authorities welcomed it, siding with the Soviet army in its brief efforts to impose military rule.
0	6	Thereafter, the two sides have gathered military forces.
0	6	The Trans Dnestr side has been augmented by Cossacks from nearby areas returning to their traditional role as defenders of Russia's borders.
0	6	The daily Izvestia reported yesterday that the Cossacks appear to have appointed themselves mercenaries for the Russians
0.338709677419355	7	TROOPS OF the former Soviet Union were ordered to pull out from the Armenian enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh yesterday after they were fired on during clashes between Azeri and Armenian militants.
0	7	Marshal Yevgeny Shaposhnikov, the Commonwealth of Independent States' defence minister, announced the decision as fighting worsened in the disputed territory in spite of efforts to secure a truce.
0	7	The enclave is administered by Azerbaijan but largely populated by Armenians.
0	7	The order for the pull-out of the 366th motorised regiment follows the deaths earlier this week of a handful of soldiers caught in the fighting between Armenian guerrillas and Azerbaijani forces.
0	7	Fighting flared again yesterday in the capital Stepanakert, where the regiment is based.
0	7	Azerbaijani and Armenian officials claimed their civilian targets were under particularly vicious attack.
0.546875	7	Marshal Shaposhnikov, who is also commander-in-chief, has long warned that he would withdraw troops rather than allow them to become targets of ethnic conflicts in the former Soviet Union.
0	7	No dates have been given for the withdrawal.
0	7	Troops under fire along the Armenian-Azerbaijani border will also be withdrawn.
0.12962962962963	7	Commanders of the Trans-Caucasus military district, which encompasses Georgia as well as Armenia and Azerbaijan, have been ordered to rebuff attacks on military installations.
0	7	Azeri and Armenian officials say sophisticated weapons, including combat helicopters, tanks and armoured personnel carriers, are being used by guerrillas on both sides in the four-year-old conflict.
0	7	Armenian militants attacked the last Azeri stronghold in Nagorno-Karabakh yesterday, according to Azerbaijan's interior ministry, which said residents of the town of Shusha fled as helicopter gunships swooped down from snow-covered mountains.
0.777777777777778	7	Armenians in the enclave want unification with Armenia, but Azerbaijan will not give up any territory.
0.567567567567568	8	RUSSIA and Georgia yesterday deployed helmet' troops to stop ethnic fighting in the disputed region of South Ossetia in the first peace-keeping operation since the collapse of the Soviet Union, Reuter reports from Moscow.
0	8	Reports from the remote Transcaucasian region said hundreds of heavily armed Russian troops from the 104th paratroop battalion moved into a 7km-wide security zone separating rebel South Ossetia from the rest of Georgia.
0	8	Georgian national guards occupied similar positions on their side of the border and pulled out all their men from the South Ossetian capital of Tskhinvali.
0	8	But Itar-Tass news agency said gunfire overnight near the city killed four civilians and injured two others, underscoring the difficulties facing the operation.
0.308823529411765	8	The mission was the first peace-keeping attempt anywhere in the former Soviet Union, whose disintegration last year has prompted waves of bloodletting in ethnic flashpoints from the Romanian to the Afghan borders.
0.14	8	Reports from the former Soviet republic of Moldova said several people had been killed overnight in fresh ceasefire violations between government forces and separatists.
0.106060606060606	8	In the Transcaucasian republic of Armenia, Radio Russia said five civilians had died overnight in Azerbaijani shelling, the latest victims of a four-year undeclared war which has killed 2,000 people.
0.318181818181818	8	Russia and Georgia were cautiously optimistic that Ossetia could be the first region of the former Soviet Union where armed conflict could be resolved with the help of measures and actions'.
0.304347826086957	8	South Ossetia is part of Georgia but wants to unite with neighbouring North Ossetia, which was assigned to Russia by Stalin.
0.269230769230769	8	Hundreds have been killed since 1990 in fighting between Georgians and Ossetians.
0	8	The peace-keepers have been issued with UN-style light-blue helmet bands and matching chevrons on their sleeves.
0	8	They will be joined later by a multi-ethnic force Russians, Ukrainians, Ossetians and other mountain peoples under the nominal command of North Ossetian leaders.
0	8	The peace-keepers' mission is to form a physical barrier between the two sides, opening the way to future talks.
0	8	The greatest threat is expected to come from hundreds of armed fighters on both sides, operating independently in a dozen or so bands outside the control of either Russian or Georgian authorities.
0.14	8	Interfax news agency said Russia's Vice-President Alexander Rutskoi, at present on a visit to Moldova, proposed a similar peace-keeping operation there.
0	9	RUSSIA flew 3,000 special forces to halt ethnic fighting in the troubled Caucasus mountains at the weekend, its second troop deployment in a week to support a beleaguered government in its former empire.
0	9	Russian President Boris Yeltsin sent Spetsnaz commandos and elite police to Vladikavkaz, capital of the Russian autonomous republic of North Ossetia, 1,100 miles south of Moscow.
0.125	9	The troops were sent to halt fighting between Ossetians and a regional ethnic group, the Ingush, who officials claimed were setting fire to Ossetian-owned homes.
0	9	Scores were reported killed and injured in street fighting between Ossetians and Ingush in the past several days.
0	9	Ingush rebels were reported yesterday to have taken hostage 80 Russian interior ministry soldiers based in the region.
0	9	A local official said the soldiers were seized on Friday in the Dzhermen settlement, located near the regional capital, Vladikavkaz, and populated mostly by Ingushis, Mr Felix Gutnov, spokesman for the North Ossetian interior ministry, said.
0.65625	9	The Ingush, who declared an independent state in June, are demanding the return of lands that Russian leader Josef Stalin expropriated in 1944 and declared part of North Ossetia.
0	9	Mr Yeltsin and Russian Prime Minister Yegor Gaidar held emergency meetings on the crisis on Saturday and yesterday.
0	9	At the same time, the North Ossetian government said it would distribute Russian army-supplied automatic weapons to civilian volunteers.
0.2	9	Russian authorities are strong enough to make all those violating the law respect it,' Russian Deputy Prime Minister Georgy Khizha, Mr Yeltsin's specialist on the Caucasus, told Russian television.
0	9	The Russian action mirrored recent developments in the former Soviet republic of Tajikistan, where Russian troops have also been deployed.
0.375	9	The Central Asian nation, which has yet to form its own army since the Soviet Union collapsed last December, has also distributed weapons to civilians.
0	9	On October 26-27 Russian soldiers played a crucial role in crushing a coup attempt in the Tajik capital of Dushanbe.
0.152173913043478	9	The Caucasus mountains, which stretch from southern Russia to the borders of Turkey and Iran, are engulfed by several conflicts.
0	9	Among them are Georgia's war with Abkhazian separatists, and Azerbaijan's conflict with ethnic Armenians in Nagorno-Karabakh.
0.662162162162162	10	The international community is starting to look beyond the conflict in the former Yugoslavia, and is becoming increasingly aware of the true magnitude and seriousness of ethnic and political conflicts in the former Soviet Union.
0	10	The problem is indeed a pressing one.
0.4375	10	The disputes in the Transcaucasus, central Asia, and elsewhere in the former Soviet Union are causing great suffering for those involved.
0	10	They are a source of legitimate concern to the Russians, who are worried by clashes close to their borders.
0	10	They are concerned too about the safety of ethnic Russians living in those countries where there are conflicts, and about the economic and social consequences of refugees fleeing to Russia
0	10	They believe that the problems in some of the former Soviet republics are either ignored or misunderstood.
0	10	The Russians fear that if they do nothing, the conflicts will worsen and probably spread.
0	10	They argue that they have a legitimate concern in trying to resolve conflicts that threaten their security.
0.194444444444444	10	They ask why, when the international community is engaged in peacemaking and peacekeeping in many of the world's trouble spots, similar efforts should not be undertaken in the hot spots near them.
0.106060606060606	10	Equally, these disputes are of legitimate concern to Britain, its western partners and the whole international community, both for humanitarian reasons and because such flashpoints risk provoking regional instability.
0	10	If uncontrolled, they pose a variety of threats to European security, including increased traffic in drugs and arms as well as international terrorism.
0	10	Crises in Russia's newly independent neighbours may also complicate Russia's relations with the west: unless they are carefully handled, they risk prejudicing the emerging relationship between us.
0	10	The west is sometimes suspicious of Moscow's attitude.
0	10	There are no differences about the need to resolve these conflicts: but there are differences over how to go about it.
0	10	The British government will not underwrite Russian involvement unless it is sure that peacekeeping troops will not turn into occupying forces.
0.338709677419355	10	Nor are countries that secured their independence when the Soviet Union was dissolved keen that the west should concede to Moscow the same role it played in the Soviet empire.
0	10	They fear that this would compromise their sovereignty.
0.145833333333333	10	When they are willing for Russian troops to play a peacekeeping role, they want there to be some form of international monitoring.
0	10	This has meant that, even though the west lacks the resources to engage directly in those trouble spots, it has been wary of appearing to endorse Russian involvement instead, in case it had imperial tendencies.
0.21875	10	If we are to fashion a joint approach by Russia and its western partners to the problem of peacekeeping in the former Soviet Union, we must address all these concerns.
0	10	Clearly Russia has an important role to play in this area.
0.426829268292683	10	If the Russians want international recognition and more active support from the international community, the west in turn needs guarantees that Russia will not regard recognition of its involvement as giving it carte blanche in the former Soviet Union.
0.368421052631579	10	Peace-keeping in the former Soviet Union, as indeed peacekeeping elsewhere, must comply with internationally recognised principles.
0	10	It needs to be looked at on a case by case basis.
0	10	Respect for the sovereignty of the newly independent countries must remain paramount.
0	10	We agreed that the principles underlying Russian, CIS or international peacekeeping operations would need to include: strict respect for the sovereignty of the countries involved; an invitation from the government concerned and the consent of the parties to the conflict; commitment to a parallel political peace process; a clear mandate setting out the role of the peacekeeping forces and an exit strategy for the peacekeeping forces deployed.
0.388888888888889	10	These principles should help stimulate a dialogue and political settlement between the parties to the conflict, focus attention and, where possible, resources on the settlement of conflicts in the former Soviet Union.
0	10	All this will help enhance Russian peacekeeping practices.
0	10	Although the Conference for Security and Co-operation in Europe and the UN lack the resources to put large numbers of peacekeepers on the ground themselves, they may be able to suggest measures to enhance transparency and to monitor the peace process.
0	10	Extending co-operation within the North Atlantic Co-operation Council, and also co-operation between Russia and Nato, might help improve training for Russian peacekeepers.
0	10	This is an area we shall need to explore further.
0	10	We also need to put much more emphasis on preventive diplomacy.
0.5	10	One of the ways in which we can help prevent conflicts is to strengthen the democratic institutions in the newly independent countries of the former Soviet Union.
0	10	The CSCE and other international institutions can play an important role here, drawing the newly independent countries into a more active dialogue on ways of promoting democratic values and principles.
0	10	We discussed ways of strengthening the CSCE's role, including the role of the High Commissioner for National Minorities, at the recent Rome ministerial meeting.
0	10	We must try to find ways of managing and resolving tensions before they erupt into conflict.
0	10	It will not be easy, but we must try.
0	10	Potentially explosive cocktails of ethnic and political animosities could spread the fire of intolerance all too easily to other countries and regions.
0.538461538461539	10	We need to deal with it together in the spirit of partnership.
0.777777777777778	10	And we need to deal with it urgently.
0	10	Our security is indivisible and we must ensure it by vigorous and imaginative efforts aimed at promoting peace for all as well as rights for all.
0	10	The authors are UK foreign secretary and Russian foreign minister
0	11	Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev warned the nation Saturday night that the country's growing ethnic strife is endangering its unity as a state as well as threatening his program of political and economic reforms.
0.152173913043478	11	Appealing for calm and for the cool consideration of grievances after weeks of continuing unrest in scattered areas of the country, Gorbachev made clear the leadership's fear that the nation is heading into a political maelstrom that could tear the Soviet Union apart.
0	11	As president, Gorbachev said, it is his to warn you about the mounting danger of worsening inter-ethnic relations and the consequences for society, for every family and for every person."
0	11	fate of perestroika and the unity of our state is at stake," he declared in a sober, 20-minute address broadcast on radio and television.
0.120689655172414	11	slogans, political instigation, setting one national group against another, the domination of some ethnic groups by others this could lead to disaster for us all.
0	11	living and the succeeding generations will curse those who pushed the nation on this course and those who failed to caution it against the dangers involved in time to prevent madness."
0.335616438356164	11	With serious ethnic clashes in Soviet Central Asia over the past month, with troops needed to maintain the peace in the southern republics of Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia and with nationalism growing stronger in the Baltic republics of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, Gorbachev is struggling to hold the Soviet Union together as a state while he pushes broad reforms that he believes will resolve most of the grievances.
0	11	Even as he spoke, Soviet officials reported new violence in the south this time between Georgians and Azerbaijanis inside the Georgian republic but in an area with many Azerbaijanis.
0	11	Roving gangs, armed with hunting rifles, gasoline bombs and other weapons, had clashed in three towns south of the capital of Tbilisi last week, leaving one man dead and 22 people seriously wounded.
0.21875	11	Although limited so far in scope, some of the ethnic conflicts could grow to the point where various regions of the country would be thrown into virtual civil war, Gorbachev suggested, and some national republics could find themselves in violent disputes with their neighbors.
0	11	Those who encourage the unrest are with fire," Gorbachev said, warning that the government will use its full powers and take most decisive measures" against those provoking the clashes, organizing attacks on minority groups or urging secession.
0.169354838709677	11	Nearly 300 people have been killed in communal clashes and related political disturbances over the past two years; tens of thousands of people have had to flee their homes, including 40,000 last month alone, to seek refuge from the violence, and nearly 25,000 special troops are now deployed in various parts of the country to maintain order.
0	11	will be no pulling of our punches in relation to those who have taken the criminal path," Gorbachev said, warning of stern measures against those engaged in communal violence or in political agitation.
0	11	Political Energy Drained
0.0564516129032258	11	The ethnic strife, much of it rooted in past Soviet policies of domination by ethnic Russians or in the forced deportation of hundreds of thousands of people during the Stalinist era, has increasingly drained the political energy necessary to push through major reforms and has provided conservative critics of reform with a potent argument against faster and broader change.
0.145833333333333	11	For Gorbachev, the spread of the unrest has forced the humiliating admission that the Soviet Union, a superpower in world terms, cannot ensure the domestic tranquility that is a first priority for any government nor can it protect its own minorities against pogroms.
0.106060606060606	11	If the strife here continued and grew, he asked, kind of example shall we set for others while calling on the whole of mankind to build a nonviolent world?"
0.569767441860465	11	Of equal gravity for Gorbachev in domestic political terms has been the growth of not only nationalism but the appearance of secessionist groups in the Baltic republics and in Armenia, Georgia and Moldavia, a Soviet republic on the Romanian border.
0	11	The whole issue is believed to have been the subject of a high-level Communist Party conference here late last week, and Gorbachev's unusual television address underscores the threat posed by the conflicts.
0.0875	11	Gorbachev acknowledged that ethnic relations are in a tight knot of contradictions" because of previous Soviet policies, particularly the effort to pull the country's 100-plus ethnic groups into a new nationality" with a unified culture.
0	11	This policy had, in fact, collided head on with growing ethnic awareness throughout the country and made the problems even worse.
0	11	Past economic policies, including the in many regions under the regime of the late President Leonid I. Brezhnev, had also made the problems more acute.
0.14	11	are also reaping today the results of lawlessness in preceding decades the deportation of whole peoples from their lands and the burying in oblivion of the national interests of small ethnic groups," Gorbachev said, alluding to actions carried out decades ago by the dictator Josef Stalin.
0	11	excesses resulted in indifference to ethnic interests, to many outstanding social and economic problems in constituent republics and autonomous regions, deformities in the development of the languages and cultures of the country's different peoples, the deteriorating demographic situation and many other negative consequences that ultimately provoked tension in inter-ethnic relations."
0.156716417910448	11	Although these questions will be dealt with during a special meeting of the Communist Party's policy-making Central Committee in late July and then debated again by the Congress of People's Deputies, the country's new national assembly, Gorbachev apparently felt that he could not wait for those debates, and he set out his own broad guidelines for dealing with the crisis.
0	11	Right of Equality
0.283783783783784	11	regardless of his nationality, should feel an equal citizen in any part of the country and have a possibility to exercise all the rights guaranteed by the Soviet Union's constitution," he said.
0	11	The refusal to recognize the basic principle of equality had led to attacks on minority groups in several parts of the country, Gorbachev said, alluding to the particularly vicious assaults on Mesketian Turks in Uzbekistan last month in which about 100 people died.
0.190909090909091	11	The Soviet leader outlined an approach that would seek to increase the feeling of various ethnic groups that they are home in their own land" and could preserve and develop their own cultures, languages and social traditions, with the Soviet Union evolving politically to be much more of a federal system.
0	11	But he said that minority communities also need to be protected so that there is a balance of rights.
0	11	have lived and will continue to live in a multi-ethnic community," he observed.
0	11	Gorbachev said that transformations in the Soviet federation" are clearly essential, promising further political reforms to make it a real federation and not just one in name only.
0	11	But he declared at the same time his firm opposition to near-total independence demanded by some nationalists, particularly in Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, and to the calls by others for the redrawing of the borders of ethnic territories.
1	11	The Soviet Union's ethnic groups have common destiny," Gorbachev said.
0	11	quest of the better, one should not embark on the path of destroying what has been built and abandoning what has already been given by the federation and what can be multiplied within its framework," he said.

0	9	THE PHOTOGRAPHER caught Winnie Mandela as she left the court after her conviction for kidnapping.
0	9	She was smiling exuberantly, as if she had just won a great victory.
0.261904761904762	9	Behind her was Nelson Mandela, eyes downcast, looking stricken and exhausted.
0.166666666666667	9	That remarkable, terrible picture spoke volumes about the drama of South Africa today, the human factors and the politics.
0	9	Most of all, it reminded us of the unimaginable burdens borne by one 72-year-old man.
0.244444444444444	9	In the 15 months since he walked free from prison, Nelson Mandela has played the chief role in talks with President F.W. de Klerk and the white government.
0.229166666666667	9	He has presided over an African National Congress divided and not yet organized for politics.
0.0916666666666667	9	He has spent his moral capital trying, unsuccessfully, to end the murderous conflict between black political factions.

0	9	But events have caught up.
0.327380952380952	9	The radicals in the ANC may well use the trial and conviction of Mrs. Mandela to arouse members against Nelson Mandela's policy of peace and negotiation.
0	9	There are rumors that at a national conference next month the radicals will try to move such older leaders as Mandela and Walter Sisulu aside to a nominal senior role.
0.130952380952381	9	It is a gloomy picture: an elderly man bearing the hopes of peace in South Africa beset by problems, personal trauma on top of political.
0	9	But I think it would be wrong to conclude that the South African drama is necessarily heading toward a tragic end.
0.0572916666666667	9	One reason for a degree of optimism is the way South Africans on all sides, most of them, have dealt with Winnie Mandela's trial: calmly and fairly.
0	9	During the years of white supremacy the law has been viciously misused.
0	9	But from all one can tell, this trial was handled professionally by the judge, Justice Michael Stegmann.

0	9	Surprisingly few supporters gathered outside the court to cheer Mrs. Mandela.
0.0964912280701754	9	The ANC issued a detached statement saying that the last word had not been spoken in the case.
0	9	Archbishop Desmond Tutu said movement is larger than any individual."
0.166666666666667	9	A more fundamental reason for hope is that F.W. de Klerk and Nelson Mandela and those for whom they speak have a common interest in creating a new, non-racial South Africa.
0	9	They need each other.
0	9	Without their agreement, there can be no solution, no outcome that leaves a viable country.
0	9	The next step is formal negotiations.
0.0523809523809524	9	They can come only when the government takes further steps to meet the reasonable ANC demand for action against violence in particular, a ban on the carrying of so-called weapons such as spears.
0.107843137254902	9	How can the government look away when 1,000 Zulus carrying spears and machetes slaughter township residents?
0	9	The time factor is crucial now.
0	9	Negotiations must start soon if the moderate center of the public, black and white, is to retain hope for a peaceful solution.
0.229166666666667	9	World and time press on Nelson Mandela.

0.294117647058823	0	The crippling drought hitting North America is expected to reduce world grain stocks to levels that may cause food shortages in many poor countries, the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization reported today.
0	0	The agency projects world cereal production in 1988 to total 1.785 billion tons, only two million tons more than last year's level, which was already below the expected production.
0.476190476190476	0	If the drought in the United States ended now, grain production would fall close to the low levels of 1983, when a drought and farmers' participation in a government crop reduction program decreased output, the agency reported.
0.972222222222222	0	As a result, world grain stocks are projected to fall below 310 million tons, or 17 percent of the level the agency considers necessary to safeguard world food security, the report said.
1	0	If crop conditions in the United States and Canada continue to deteriorate, the ratio could drop even further.
0.208333333333333	0	Such a development would have serious implications for the food security, particularly of many low-income, food-deficit countries, the report said.
0	0	The high grain prices resulting from a lower supply would hit poor, food-importing countries the hardest, the U.N. agency warned.
0.357142857142857	0	It said the rising prices could also reduce food aid from developed countries.
0	0	The most severely hit crops are coarse grains mostly maize, barley and oats, the report said.
0	0	The agency projected good harvests in other parts of the world.
0.384615384615385	0	In Asia the yearly monsoon rains started on time, and production in Europe and the Soviet is expected to be larger than last year.
0.357142857142857	0	Grain production in South America should be slightly lower this year than last.
0	0	In the Sahel region of sub-Saharan Africa, however, locusts flourishing in unexpectedly heavy rains have damaged this year's harvest.
0	0	Potential crop losses from the pests could hit 1 million tons, FAO said.
0.483870967741935	1	The drought may force the government to ease crop acreage controls next year to help the United States rebuild its grain inventories, Agriculture Secretary Richard E. Lyng said Monday.
0.606060606060606	1	But the United States will continue to be a major player in world agriculture and in 1989 should be able to bounce back from this year's drought losses, he said.
0	1	Lyng's remarks were prepared for delivery at a meeting of farm magazine, extension, advertising, co-op and broadcast editors.
0.806451612903226	1	A larger portion of the United States suffered from some degree of drought stress in May and June than at any point since records began in 1895, he said.
0.384615384615385	1	Moreover, on July 2, about 35 percent of the contiguous United States was in the severe to extreme drought category, he said.
0	1	In 1934, more than 60 percent was so rated, and in August 1954 more than 50 percent was in that category.
0.277777777777778	1	Because of the large early season area now experiencing drought in the U.S., 1988 appears to have the potential to approach or exceed the drought-affected areas of the 1930s and 1950s, Lyng said.
0.357142857142857	1	Even with the severe drought, there will be an adequate supply of food grains and livestock feed grains so that the United States will be able to take care of our domestic needs and our export demand, he said.
0	1	Lyng said total consumption of 1988 crops will probably be somewhat less than previously estimated because prices are much higher.
0	1	But it is important to note that we will have no shortages, that we will still be able to accommodate the needs of our overseas buyers, he said.
0.232558139534884	2	Kentucky's governor has criticized the federal government for being too slow in dealing with the drought, and Iowa's governor warns that farmers in his state still face potential disaster despite up to five inches of rain over the weekend.
0	2	Crews began installing pumps on barges Monday to haul fresh water to southern Louisiana towns plagued by rising salt levels in the lower Mississippi River.
0	2	Meanwhile, House Speaker Jim Wright said in Washington he hopes that a relief package with disaster payments of up to $100,000 for drought-stricken farmers will win committee approval and be ready for floor action in Congress this week.
0.5	2	The drought may force the government to ease crop acreage controls next year to help the United States rebuild its grain inventories, says Agriculture Secretary Richard E. Lyng.
0.588235294117647	2	But the United States will continue to be a major player in world agriculture and in 1989 should be able to bounce back from this year's drought losses, he said Monday.
0.806451612903226	2	A larger portion of the United States suffered from some degree of drought stress in May and June than at any point since records began in 1895, Lyng said.
0	2	Grain and soybean futures have dropped to their lowest levels in more than five weeks as weekend rains in the Midwest prompted a third straight day of plummeting prices on the Chicago Board of Trade.
0	2	July soybeans fell 66 cents a bushel Monday to $8.58, the lowest price for that contract since June 3.
0	2	Corn for July delivery dropped 20{ cents to $2.89 a bushel, the lowest level since June 15.
0	2	Wheat and oat futures also closed lower.
0	2	Crude oil futures prices have hit their lowest closing level since late 1986, hurt by a selloff that traders blame on too much supply and renewed skepticism about OPEC's ability to restrain production.
0.178571428571429	2	Monday's decline erased gains made last week that had been based on fears of supply disruptions caused by the oil platform explosion in the North Sea.
0	2	On the New York Mercantile Exchange, an important barometer of price trends, the August-delivery price for West Texas Intermediate crude settled at $14.78 per barrel, down from $15.46 late Friday.
0	2	It was the lowest closing price for the near-month crude contract since a $14.71 close on Nov. 3, 1986.
0.135135135135135	2	Savings institution depositors withdrew more money from their accounts than they deposited in May for the first time in seven months, while losses continued to erode the ailing industry's capital, the government reports.
0.2	2	The Federal Home Loan Bank Board said Monday net withdrawals at the nation's 3,102 federally insured S&amp;Ls totaled $941 million in May.
0	2	But the decline came after seven consecutive months of net deposit gains totaling $28 billion.

0.128205128205128	3	Heavy rain deluged some drought-hit areas as Congress began working on a package of relief for America's farmers, and farmers in Kentucky today greeted the arrival of the first shipment of hay airlifted free from Oregon.
0.116279069767442	3	Everything looks so good with a bit of rain over the past 24 hours, farmer Herman Krone said Tuesday at his 2,800-acre farm in southern Illinois, which President Reagan plans to visit Thursday during a tour of the drought-stricken area.
0	3	However, Krone said, almost one-third of his 1,200 acres of corn already have been lost.
0	3	Marth Wilkinson, wife of Kentucky Gov. Wallace Wilkinson and business manager of the family's farm, was at Louisville's Standiford Field today for the arrival of the first hay shipment from Portland, Ore.
0.185185185185185	3	United Parcel Service plans to ship free of charge 20 to 30 tons of hay from Portland to Louisville each day for the next two weeks.
0.263157894736842	3	The Agriculture Department, meanwhile, issued a report predicting severe damage to the harvest from the drought.
0	3	It estimated, for example, that corn output this year would shrivel to 5.2 billion bushels, down from 7.06 billion last year.
0	3	The dry weather is the largest drought that our nation has ever experienced, Agriculture Secretary Richard E. Lyng told legislators.
0	3	I think history will show that it's truly more mammoth than any of us has ever experienced.
0.3125	3	Extremely heavy rain fell Tuesday in sections of Texas, Louisiana, Oklahoma and Arkansas.
0	3	In Texas, more than 6{ inches fell in 75 minutes in Mesquite, washing a pickup truck and several cars into a creek and leaving some homes 8 inches deep in water.

0	3	Nearly 6 inches fell in DeQueen, Ark.
0	3	Showers and thunderstorms were widespread over the Middle Atlantic States, the Tennessee Valley and the Gulf Coast states.
0	3	Thunderstorms boomed today over the Dakotas and Minnesota.
0.135135135135135	3	In Washington, the House and Senate Agriculture committees began working on wide-ranging legislation that would provide payments of up to $100,000 each to farmers whose crops have been wiped out by the dry spell.
0	3	House Agriculture Committee Chairman E. Kika de la Garza, D-Texas, called for final action on the measure by mid-August.
0.294117647058823	3	The drought has dried up pastures, forcing livestock farmers to go far afield for hay.
0.303030303030303	3	The hay that arrived in Kentuky today will be stored at a fairgrounds, and distributed next week by lottery to farmers, who will pay for the hay, officials said.
0.238095238095238	3	It seems like everyone in the state wants this hay, state Department of Agriculture spokesman Roger Nesbitt said Tuesday.
0.5	3	The delay has angered some farmers, such as Bernetta Smith, who expects to run out of hay for her 147 beef cows in one to two days.
0	3	I don't see any sense in storing it because people need this hay.
0	3	I don't understand it, she said.
0	3	At least 50 truckloads of hay gathered from the Carolinas and Virginia are being shipped to Ohio on Thursday in a drive organized by the Charlotte Motor Speedway and the National Association for Stock Car Auto Racing.
0.625	3	Despite the recent rain, communities with dried-up water supplies continue to restrict water use.
0.119047619047619	3	Until the drought ends, the 650 residents of Vintondale, Pa., about 50 miles east of Pittsburgh, will have to do without running water from 7 p.m. to 7 a.m. every day, Mayor Michael Palovich said Tuesday.
0	3	Palovich said he was trying to arrange for an emergency supply to be trucked in.
0.588235294117647	3	The drought has had a silver lining for anglers in the Reno, Nevada, area.
0.27027027027027	3	The state Board of Wildlife Commissioners removed the limit on catches at Rye Patch and Lahontan reservoirs because the reservoirs are expected to be dry by the end of summer, leaving fish high and dry.
0	4	Here is a state-by-state summary of drought developments Wednesday: The Alabama National Guard is still hauling up to 25,000 gallons of water a day to 10 communities across the state despite recent rains.
0.555555555555555	4	At the height of the drought last month, the Guard was hauling water to 12 locations.
0	4	The Guard's water-hauling program has been in continuous operation since last July in west-central Alabama because of a low water table.
0	4	In an effort to help Georgia farmers locate hay, the state Department of Agriculture announced it will start compiling a list of sources.
0	4	Commissioner Tommy Irvin urged those with a surplus for sale to contact the department.
0	4	He said information will be compiled and updated regularly.
0	4	State Treasurer Jerry Cosentino announced a program to provide drought-stricken farmers with access to commercial loans with below-market interest rates.
0	4	The treasurer's office will commit $50 million to banks at a lower-than-normal interest yield and in turn those banks will offer farmers loans with rates as low as 10 percent.
0	4	I know what the farmers first need is rain but that is out of our hands right now, Cosentino said.
0	4	The next best thing they can get would be additional funds to carry them over until next year.
0	4	A group of Indiana farmers sued a New Jersey insurance company, saying the company acted in bad faith when it reneged on $2.5 million in drought insurance.
0	4	The lawsuit seeks an undeterminable amount of damages from Pio-Gard Agency of Ohio Inc. and Federal Insurance Co., a subsidiary of the Chubb Group Insurance Cos. of Warren, N.J. Forecasters say Iowa's weather is returning to the hot, dry drought pattern which settled over the state for much of June.
0.178571428571429	4	The first emergency shipment of Oregon hay to help drought-stricken Kentucky farmers arrived, but logistical problems forced agriculture officials to delay its distribution until next week.
0	4	It's a nightmare trying to find a fair way to do this, said Roger Nesbitt, a spokesman for the Kentucky Department of Agriculture.
0.185185185185185	4	Nesbitt said Wednesday's 20-ton shipment, flown free from Portland, Ore., by United Parcel Service, will be sold to farmers on Monday.
0.125	4	Heavy rain fell on some of the driest areas of central and east-central Minnesota, but it was way, way below what we should have, as far as precipitation goes, a National Weather Service hydrologist said.
0	4	We need a widespread distribution over a long period of time, say maybe 10 inches of rainfall to get us back to what we normally should be, Gary McDevitt said.
0.192307692307692	4	It was the heaviest rainfall for the east-central part of the state since April 26, when the area got about a half-inch of rain.
0.357142857142857	4	Weather experts say Mississippi could see above normal rainfall in the coming week.
0.227272727272727	4	Rainfall during the week ending Wednesday averaged 1 inch in some areas, with some extreme northern counties receiving greater amounts.
0.238095238095238	4	But the weather service said all Mississippi farm communities still had only 30 percent to 50 percent of normal moisture.
0	4	Road builders in the Kansas City area say the effects of dry weather in the Midwest this year are not all bad.
0.32258064516129	4	Engineers say several highway projects in the area will be open to traffic at least a month earlier than expected because of fewer interruptions caused by rain and wet weather.
0	4	As many as 20 fires, sparked by lightning from thunderstorms, have blackened about 1,500 acres in the Custer National Forest.
0	4	The fires are being fought by from 150 to 200 firefighters.
0	4	A lightning-caused fire in the Bob Marshall Wilderness Area of northwest Montana was being allowed to burn naturally, officials said.
0.208333333333333	4	State Agriculture Director Roy Frederick said Nebraska farmers probably will have better crops than are expected nationwide and may benefit from higher prices.
0.138888888888889	4	Nebraska's outlook for the corn crop is rosier than national predictions because 75 percent of the corn comes from irrigated acres and Nebraska has received more rain than some other states, he said.
0.238095238095238	4	Gov. George Sinner has asked federal officials to declare all 53 North Dakota counties disaster areas because of the drought.
0.476190476190476	4	Sinner says the drought has wiped out small grain crops and is beginning to take a toll on row crops.
0.3125	4	The State Agricultural Statistics Service said North Dakota farmers will abandon 31 percent of their spring wheat this year and harvest the smallest crop in 19 years because of the drought.
0	4	That compares to a normal abandonment of about 5 percent.
0	4	Abandonment has not been so high in the state since the 1930s.
0	4	Lt. Gov. Paul Leonard, who heads a state drought task force, said he would not advocate statewide mandatory water restrictions but said local governments should have the authority to impose restrictions where necessary.
0	4	In central Ohio, farmers awaited what will be the largest haylift of the season 50 truckloads of hay from the South scheduled to arrive Thursday night in Columbus.
0	4	Thunderstorms hit Brown County with heavy rain and hail that damaged drought-stricken crops.
0	4	Rain was heavy north and east of Aberdeen and spotty elsewhere.
0	4	Stanley and Thelma Dennert, who live three miles west of Houghton, reported 3.75 inches of rain within an hour.
0	4	It was hard with a little bit of hail.
0	4	It really came down in sheets, said Mrs. Dennert.
0	4	Authorities said no tornado sightings were confirmed, but about a dozen funnel clouds were reported.
0	4	The drought-plagued Mississippi River measured seventh-tenths of a foot higher than expected at Memphis because of rainfall throughout West Tennessee.
0	4	The Mississippi was still 21 feet lower than normal for this time of year, however, and the Coast Guard said the slight rise had no effect on commercial traffic on the river.
0.333333333333333	4	The drought has dried up summer jobs at the Stokley USA cannery in Merrill.
0	4	During most summers, the plant provides three months' employment for about 300 workers on three shifts, but this year there are only 225 seasonal employees on two shifts, said Vern Warren, plant manager.
0	4	It's been on and off so far.
0.333333333333333	4	The drought conditions have made it a little difficult for us, Warren said.
0	5	Weather forecasters today were offering drought-stricken farmers little prospect of relief in separate outlooks for the next 30 days and three months.
0.161290322580645	5	A new climate assessment of the ongoing drought said many areas now experiencing extreme drought have less than a 4 percent chance of recovering from the drought within 3 months.
0	5	The disappointing forecast came as President Reagan headed to the Midwest to inspect drought-plagued farms.
0	5	On Tuesday the Agriculture Department reported sharp declines in the outlook for several crops.
0.111111111111111	5	That was followed Wednesday by a 30-day forecast from the National Weather Service saying that drought-stricken areas from the Dakotas east to New York and from the Canadian border to Oklahoma, Arkansas and Tennessee are likely to continue to be short of rain.
0	5	That area, which includes the major grain-growing states where crops already are suffering, is given a 55 percent chance of less than normal rainfall.
0.185185185185185	5	And some states in the center of the area, stretching from West Virginia to Nebraska and from Wisconsin to Missouri, may be even drier.
0	5	They are given a 60 percent chance of being short of precipitation.
0	5	A slice of southern California, including Los Angeles, is the driest area in the forecast, with a 70 percent chance of having below normal rainfall.
0	5	The rest of coastal California also will be dry, the forecast said.
0	5	The outlook also says there's a 55 percent chance of hotter than normal temperatures through the U.S. heartland from New England to Idaho and from the Canadian border to Oklahoma.
0.166666666666667	5	Within that area, the chances of high temperatures are above 65 percent in Wyoming, while central Midwestern states have a 60 percent chance of above average temperatures.
0.227272727272727	5	Wetter than normal weather is predicted for west and south Texas, and parts of New Mexico, Arizona and Utah.
0.238095238095238	5	Normal precipitation is forecast for the Atlantic and Gulf coast states, along with the Northwest and northern Mountain States.
0.217391304347826	5	The Weather Service said normal temperatures are expected for the Atlantic states from Virginia south, and for the Gulf Coast states.
0.384615384615385	5	West Texas and New Mexico may be cooler than normal, but the far West is expected to see its normal quota of summer heat.
0.25	5	The separate drought impact assessment, issued by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Climate Office, points out that predicting an end to the drought is a complex thing, since dry spells have no normal lifetime.
0	5	The low 4 percent probability of an end within 3 months is based simply on a statistical analysis of past droughts, the agency said.
0.3125	5	The report noted that as of the end of June, 29 percent of the continental United States was experiencing severe or extreme drought, with parts of 35 states affected.
0.161290322580645	5	That puts the current drought on the same level as the one in 1911, but still less severe than the droughts of 1936, 1931, 1956 and 1934.
0.344827586206897	6	Weather experts discussed the drought Thursday and its possible causes and effects, and said they hoped to produce a consensus on how much longer it will last.
0.3125	6	All of the speakers at the 1988 Drought Symposium called for more research and study.
0	6	There's an enormous number of possibilities that one could chase.
0	6	The next business of the scientist is to eliminate the possibilities of and extend the range of analysis and look for cause and effect, said David Rodenhuis, director of the federal Climate Analysis Center in Washington.
0	6	The symposium attended by 13 state and national experts was sponsored by The Weather Channel, an Atlanta-based cable network, which broadcast the meeting live.
0.108695652173913	6	John Hope, the network's hurricane specialist and a former forecaster with the National Hurricane Center in Miami, Fla., said the drought in the Southeast might be lessened or ended in the next few months by a heavier than normal hurricane season.
0	6	Hope said current weather conditions point to more tropical storms, more of which should become hurricanes, in this hurricane season.
0.227272727272727	6	He stressed that a hurricane's effect on drought is variable, depending on the intensity and speed of the storm.
0	6	Nevertheless, he said, some Southeastern states get as much as 25 pecent of their rainfall in some months from hurricanes.
0	6	Georgia state climatologist Gayther Plummer told the symposium he thought the position of the planet Jupiter had something to do with drought in the Southeast.
0	6	However, Rodenhuis said he was skeptical about Plummer's thesis.
0	6	It's very necessary to be cautious and analytical about the issue, he said.
0.142857142857143	7	Public interest in the Earth's troubled climate may be washed away with the heavy rains that are needed to end the current U.S. drought, weather experts warned during a drought symposium here.
0	7	Society tends to flit from hysteria to hysteria, said Pat Michaels, Virginia's state climatologist and moderator of the symposium.
0	7	He said the 1988 drought, although not as dry as a 1986 drought in many places, has drawn much attention because some of the affected areas include large media centers.
0	7	I'm worried that when the next drought happens, we are going to have to rediscover the climate problem, said Michaels, president of the Association of State Climatologists.
0.277777777777778	7	Experts said Thursday that the greenhouse effect the warming of the Earth's atmosphere has brought needed attention to changes in the global climate, even though it is not directly related to the drought.
0	7	Many of the 13 climatologists and meterologists at the symposium agreed that the Earth's temperature is warming, but they debated whether it is a short- or long-term phenomenon and its impact on Earth.
0.121951219512195	7	However, Alan Hecht, director of the National Climate Program in Washington, D.C., said the uncertainty means policymakers should begin to deal with the possible effects, especially undertaking policies that make sense in their own right.
0	7	Mankind must reduce reliance on fossil fuels, he said, by becoming more energy efficient, replanting forests and investigating alternative energy supplies.
0	7	Scientists have warned in recent years that Earth's atmosphere is gaining in carbon dioxide and other gases, which trap heat and cause the overall temperature to rise.
0	7	Besides fossil fuels, the depletion of forests in South America has been blamed for the increase of carbon dioxide and methane.
0.185185185185185	7	Some have warned that higher temperature will change the character of many countries, for example drying out the U.S. Midwest or melting polar ice caps.
0	7	The symposium was sponsored by The Weather Channel, an Atlanta-based cable network, which broadcast the meeting live.
0	7	Earlier Thursday, the climatologists were told the movement of planets and the moon and sunspots may help lead to drought in the Southeast.
0	7	There is some evidence that as Jupiter goes around the sun at its fastest point, there are drought conditions in the Southeast in the months of April and October, Georgia state climatologist Gayther Plummer said.
0	7	However, David Rodenhuis, director of the federal Climate Analysis Center in Washington, said he was skeptical of Plummer's thesis.
0	7	There's an enormous number of possibilities that one could chase, Rodenhuis said.
0	7	The next business of the scientist is to extend the range of analysis and look for cause and effect.
0	8	Here is a state-by-state summary of the latest drought developments: Recent rain in central and south Alabama haven't helped cities' water supplies enough to lift surcharges and limits on outdoor watering.
0.135135135135135	8	Northern Alabama has missed most of the rain and the region's top crop, cotton, is in a critical situation, said John Trotman, state director of the Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service.
0.37037037037037	8	Georgia's carpet industry may be forced to reduce production and lay off workers if the drought continues for an extended period, industry officials said.
0	8	It is something you don't like to think about, but if you don't have water, you can't run your mills, said John A. Shaheen, vice chairman of World Carpets Inc. in Dalton.
0.217391304347826	8	The drought has inflicted serious damage to wildlife along the Illinois River, even though the water level has remained near normal.
0.113636363636364	8	Wayne Herndon, a biologist with the state Department of Conservation, said the drought, now nearly midway through its second summer, has damaged the river's backwater lakes, virtually eliminating a year's supply of the river's gamefish.
0	8	The mercury hit 100 degrees Friday at O'Hare International Airport, bettering the previous high for the day of 99 and establishing a second record by giving the city its fifth 100-degree or better temperature of the summer.
0	8	Chicago sweltered through four 100-degree days in 1934, 1947 and 1953.

0	8	No injuries were reported.
0	8	The Indiana Board of Health issued a heat warning as temperatures soared above 100 and humidity levels boosted the heat index to more than 110 degrees.
0	8	The National Weather Service said the conditions likely would continue through the weekend.
0.15625	8	National Guardsmen stood by with 400 gallons of drinking water for about 50 homes in Elk Horn while officials tried to find more water to get the town through the drought.
0.454545454545455	8	The U.S. Agriculture Department announced Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng would visit Iowa as part of a 10-state tour of drought areas.
0	8	Severe thunderstorms spawning tornadoes and strong winds rolled across central Kansas Friday night.
0	8	A tornado touched down near Clay Center, destroying an unoccupied mobile home and damaging barns and hog sheds.
0	8	High winds also damaged trees and power lines.
0	8	Agriculture Commissioner Ward Butch Burnette returned from Oregon, saying he had prospects for perhaps 10,000 tons of hay, badly needed by cattle producers.
0.161290322580645	8	One railroad, CSX Transportation Corp., offered to bring the hay free of charge from Chicago if the Union Pacific or Burlington Northern lines could get it to Chicago.
0	8	Thirty tons of Oregon hay arrived by jet in Louisville, courtesy of United Parcel Service.
0	8	That shipment, like several others, was earmarked for distribution Monday.
0	8	Severe thunderstorms accompanied by high winds and hail moved over much of Michigan on Friday, downing trees and causing power outages.
0.277777777777778	8	Concern over the effects of the drought on the timber industry outweighed relief brought by the showers.
0	8	You have to take more precautions, and you can't use certain machinery with exhaust systems that send sparks that might set a fire, said Matt Repar, who has been logging for 28 years.
0	8	The U.S. Forest Service has banned all machinery with internal combustion engines from the Upper Peninsula's Hiawatha National Forest after noon.
0.2	8	John McGregor of the state Department of Natural Resources has said that if the drought keeps up, the state may ban commercial logging.
0	8	A brief thunderstorm brought little relief following record heat that helped kill 3,000 young turkeys near Princeton and prompted health warnings.
0	8	Friday's high of 102 degrees in the Twin Cities topped the previous record for the date, 101 degrees i 1931.
0	8	With the heat index the summertime equivalent of the wind-chill factor forecasters said 102 degrees felt like 114.
0	8	This is the kind of situation that is really bad for the sick and elderly, and especially the elderly, said Greg Spoden, assistant state climatologist.
0.37037037037037	8	Gov. John Ashcroft issued his second statewide heat alert of the summer, urging private and public organizations to aid those suffering from the sizzling temperatures.
0	8	Unless we act now to gear up public and private efforts to care for those without shelter from the stifling heat, the potential for human loss over the weekend is staggering, Ashcroft said.
0	8	More than 700 firefighters battled a lightning-caused blaze that combined with other fires and spread to 14,800 acres in the Custer National Forest of southeast Montana.
0	8	Bulldozers, helicopters and bombers dropping fire retardant fought the blaze in the tinder-dry forest on the South Dakota border The Army Corps of Engineers has further reduced the flow of water through Orwell Dam on the Otter Tail River near Fergus Falls, Minn., a main feeder of the Red River, which runs along the Minnesota-North Dakota border.
0	8	The reduction could affect Fargo's supply of water, according to Ron Hendrickson, city water plant superintendent.

0	8	In Columbus, farmers began loading up their shares of more than 40,000 bales of hay delivered this week from three Southern states.
0	8	Farmers in the southwestern corner of the state postponed cloud-seeding because there were no clouds.
0	8	Representatives from Japanese flour mills visited with wheat producers.
0.15625	8	Ben Handcock, executive director of the South Dakota Wheat Commission, said the Japanese would buy wheat, but probably not from this year's crop because of the drought.
0.25	8	They heard about the drought the same as everybody else did and they think we're out of wheat.
0	8	The fact of the matter is that we have a lot of good quality wheat left from last year and previous years, Handcock said.
0.454545454545455	8	Farmers say the drought is causing a shortage of feed, grass and water, leading them to sell more livestock.
0.185185185185185	8	At the Tennessee-Kentucky Livestock Inc. auction barn in Guthrie, Ky., livestock sales have doubled, said an owner of the barn, Dorris Bryant.
0	8	Gov. Tommy G. Thompson signed a drought relief bill Friday making $35 million in emergency loans available to Wisconsin farmers.

0	2	Kuwait's land and sea borders were closed, as was the airport.
0.0972222222222222	2	Diplomats said the invasion was too swift to arrange the evacuation of nationals, and foreigners were asked to keep a low profile.

0	3	The sources spoke on condition of anonymity.
0	3	The Council meeting of foreign ministers was convened in Cairo at Kuwaiti request hours after Iraqi military forces took over the small Persian Gulf state.
0	3	Some member nations sent lower-level representatives.
0	3	Following its evening session, attended by Saadoon Hamadi, a member of the Iraqi Revolutionary Council, Foreign Minister Esmat Abdel-Meguid of Egypt told reporters the Council would meet again Friday.
0.137254901960784	3	Saddam promised Mubarak two weeks ago that he would not invade Kuwait in their oil dispute.
0.32183908045977	3	At Thursday's closed session, Hamadi reiterated Iraq's claim its forces entered Kuwait at the request of a Kuwaiti revolutionary group that had overthrown the government.
0.0804597701149425	3	A conference source said several Arab foreign ministers replied that they considered this to be an Iraqi invasion which is against all United Nations and Arab League conventions.
0.108527131782946	3	So far, only Lebanon's prime minister and foreign minister, Salim Hoss, has joined Kuwait in Cairo in publicly condemning the invasion the first time in modern history one Arab country invaded another to take control of the government.
0	3	Hoss told reporters, We do not see any justification for what happened, whatever the arguments and pretexts.
0.388888888888889	3	The invasion was denounced by the United States and other Western nations and by the Soviet Union.

0	3	Arab leaders must take the initiative and stop this bloodshed and return things to their normal situation.
0.233333333333333	3	We also call on Iraq to withdraw its troops.
0.233333333333333	3	Hamadi told reporters upon arrival, I see this meeting as unnecessary There is no government presently in Kuwait.
0	3	There is a group which started the revolution and which will reveal itself shortly.
0	3	His comments were carried by the Middle East News Agency.
0.0804597701149425	3	MENA said Kuwait invoked the 1950 Arab joint defense pact and asked the Arab League Council to dispatch a joint Arab force to defend Kuwait against the invasion.
0.053030303030303	3	In the event of military aggression against any League member, the pact all members, to take, individually and collectively, all steps available, including the use of armed force, to repel the aggression and restore security and peace.

0	3	All Arab League members also belong to the Islamic conference.
0.194444444444444	4	Iraq says it invaded Kuwait at the request of a revolutionary organization there, but diplomats dismiss that rationale as a large-scale charade.
0	4	The diplomatic world has remained largely unconviced by the flood of statements issued from Iraq in the name of the Provisional Free Kuwait Government.
0	4	Britain's U.N. ambassador, Crispin Tickell, called the Iraqi action an invasion from the outside a phony coup d'etat from within.
0.155555555555556	4	He said the invasion had led to the purported establishment of a puppet government.
0.304347826086957	4	In a rare display of solidarity, the United States and the Soviet Union called for Iraq to withdraw and imposed sanctions.
0.848484848484849	4	The U.N. Security Council voted 14-0 to condemn the invasion.
0.113821138211382	4	But Iraq's deputy permanent U.N. representative, Sabah Talat Kadrat, said the Security Council should not be debating the issue, because the fall of the Kuwaiti Emir, Sheik Jaber Al-Ahmed Al-Sabah, was an internal matter.
0	4	The official Kuwait News Agency, monitored in Nicosia, did not issue a single story all day.
0	4	Its computer periodically sputtered out the phrase Line cut.
0	4	On the other hand, state-run Iraqi News Agency from Baghdad came alive with a series of communiques from the provisional government.
0	4	The members were not identified.
0.0729166666666667	4	The first statement said the provisional government finds that one of its primordial obligations is to remedy the harm done by the deposed, corrupt government to our brothers in Iraq.
0.212121212121212	4	Iraq has been feuding with Kuwait over a border dispute.
0.137254901960784	4	It has also accused Kuwait of violating its oil production quotas set by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, costing Iraq of much-needed revenues because oil is cheaper when supplies are higher.
0	4	The statement on the Iraqi News Agency said the border dispute would be settled with fraternity and Arab national interests, indicating Iraq would probably take the land it wants.
0.0752688172043011	4	The statement also said the Al-Sabah family, which had ruled Kuwait for almost 250 years, was working in concert with Zionist and colonial powers to plot against Iraq.
0	4	That is the charge the Iraqi press leveled at Kuwait when tensions began to rise in mid-July.
0	4	Falsification of elections, authoritarianism, persecution of patriotic personalities have always been characteristics of the Al-Sabah family, the statement said.
0	4	Kuwait is one of the few Arab states that has experimented with a freely elected parliament.
0	4	A new National Council with 50 members voted into office and 25 appointed by the emir took office after June elections.
0	4	The communiques from the Iraqi News Agency said the National Council has been disbanded.
0.0729166666666667	5	THE INVASION: Iraq's troops, led by about 350 tanks, crossed the border at dawn Thursday, and seized the Kuwaiti palace and government buildings 40 miles away.

0	5	The soldiers were also making sweeps through the southern oilfields, according to residents and Lloyds' insurance service in London.
0.0897435897435898	5	Diplomatic sources estimate more than 200 Kuwaitis were killed or wounded, mainly from the Emiri Guard which bore the main brunt of the invasion.
0	5	Kuwait's Sheik Saad al-Abdullah al-Sabah fled to safety in Saudi Arabia.
0.0686274509803922	5	THE FORCES: Iraq, a country of more than 17 million, has the Arab world's most battle-trained army, and had massed more than 100,000 soldiers on the Kuwaiti border.
0.116666666666667	5	Kuwait, an oil-rich city-state, has 1.9 million residents 60 percent foreigners and an army of 20,300 soldiers.
0.56	5	CAUSE OF CONFLICT: President Saddam Hussein of Iraq accused Kuwait of stealing oil from its territory and forcing down oil prices through overproduction.
0.518518518518518	5	Kuwait and U.N. diplomats dismissed Iraq's claim that it invaded at the request of Kuwaiti revolutionaries.
0.717948717948718	5	REACTION: The U.N. Security Council voted 14-0 to condemn the invasion.
0.291666666666667	5	President Bush denounced it as naked agression.
0.614035087719298	5	He froze Iraq's assets in the United States and blocked almost all Iraqi imports, including oil.
0	5	The order also froze Kuwait property under U.S. jurisdiction a move intended to keep Iraq from seizing it.
0.538461538461539	5	The Soviets also condemned the invasion and stopped arms sales to Iraq.
0.333333333333333	5	Kuwait's U.S. ambassador said the nation had asked for American military intervention.
0	5	A Pentagon source said a U.S. naval group was diverted toward the Persian Gulf.
0.686274509803922	5	Oil prices soared in frenzied trading amid fears the invasion would reduce the supply of oil.
0.202898550724638	6	Iraqi President Saddam Hussein seemed determined to solve his financial problems and fulfill territorial ambitions by dethroning the government of neighboring Kuwait.
0.0833333333333333	6	The invasion, unprecedented in modern Arab history, reflected the brutality Saddam has used to crush all opposition at home since coming to power in 1979.
0.301075268817204	6	The sentence for criticizing Saddam is death, and the president considered Kuwait's oil overproduction and the subsequent fall in the price of oil a personal affront to Iraq.
0.137254901960784	6	Iraqis will not forget the saying that cutting necks is better than cutting means of living.
0	6	Oh God Almighty, be witness that we have warned them, he said last month after prices tumbled below $14 per barrel.
0.150537634408602	6	He accused Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates of costing Iraq $14 billion in lost oil revenue by ignoring their quotas assigned by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.
0.227642276422764	6	He also accused Kuwait of stealing $2.4 billion by pumping oil from a disputed field that straddled their border, and demanded that Kuwait write off an estimated $15 billion it loaned Iraq during the Persian Gulf war.
0	6	Saddam was reported to be incensed that Kuwait was demanding repayment for the wartime loans.
0	6	Saddam said he fought the war to protect the Arabs from the fundamentalist revolution fomented by the late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini in Persian, mainly Shiite Moslem Iran.
0.0752688172043011	6	Never mind that Iraq started the war in 1980 by invading Iran after a series of border skirmishes along the Shatt-al-Arab waterway, Iraq's only outlet to the Gulf.
0.0972222222222222	6	Despite claims that the war was an unprecedented victory, the long conflict stalled Iraq's development, dragging on for eight years.
0	6	It has still not formally ended.
0	6	The war bills kept the government from delivering material benefits promised to the Iraqi people directly after the war.
0	6	The 1990 budget slashed funds for imports and Iraqis were told to brace for another year of austerity.
0.291666666666667	6	Private investment has failed to take hold.
0	6	Iraq ended the war an estimated $70 billion in debt.
0	6	Its main gulf port of Basra is still blocked and its oil infrastructure damaged.
0	6	Tens of thousands of Iraqi prisoners of war languish in Iranian prisons and an estimated 500,000 Iraqis were killed or wounded.
0.137254901960784	6	Despite its puny size, Kuwait's oil reserves almost match Iraq's 100 billion barrels.
0.172839506172839	6	By controlling Kuwait, Saddam could help solve the financial hangover from the Persian Gulf war and fulfill Iraq's longstanding wish for more gulf coastline.
0.160919540229885	6	Iraq's 100,000 troops massed at the border in the past few weeks were believed part of a pressure campaign to make Kuwait capitulate to Iraq's demands.
0.0614035087719298	6	But Kuwait's pledge two weeks ago to obey new OPEC quotas and Saddam's promise to Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak that he would not invade lulled the Arab world into the sense the crisis was over.
0	6	Homage to the cause of Arab unity has been paramount in Middle East politics since postwar independence from colonial powers.
0	6	Although a civil war in Yemen in the 1960s brought Egyptian and Saudi Arabian intervention on opposing sides, no Arab state has ever directly deposed the government of a fellow Arab League member.
0.116666666666667	6	Despite Iraqi claims that it is helping internal opposition liberate Kuwait, it has long coveted the tiny emirate.
0.269230769230769	6	The Iraqi government refused to recognize its independence in 1961 and threatened to attack then, but backed down when Britain landed troops in Kuwait.
0.233333333333333	6	The invasion shook Kuwait's neighbors along the Gulf.
0.0864197530864197	6	It proved the decade-old Gulf Cooperation Council that groups Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, Oman and Kuwait was toothless.
0	6	The GCC did not issue a statement, much less implement its mutual defense treaty.
0	6	While Iraq was unlikely to invade Saudi Arabia, it could use the precedent of Kuwait to browbeat its neighbors on local policy issues.
0	6	Bombing an oil field would be a sufficient reminder of what happened to Kuwait when it balked at Iraqi demands.
0	6	Also in a region entirely ruled by absolute monarchs, the fall of one makes the rest feel extremely vulnerable.
0.116666666666667	6	In a series of bellicose statements in recent months, Saddam has sought to focus domestic attention outside Iraq.
0.202898550724638	6	In March he threatened to burn half of Israel with Iraq's chemical weapons banned under international law if Iraq was attacked.
0	6	It was a popular stance among Arabs frustrated with the lack of progress toward peace and a Palestinian nation in the Arab-Israeli conflict.
0	6	Then Britain arrested several people on charges they were smuggling nuclear triggers into Baghdad.
0	6	Weeks later, police in Europe impounded what they said was parts to a supergun capable of firing chemical or nuclear shells into Israel.
0	6	Saddam cried foul, claiming the West was trying to wreck the scientific progress of the Arabs.
0	6	Saddam has sought to inherit the mantle of the late Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nassar as the leader of the Arab world.
0	6	His relentless personality cult has dubbed him The Knight of the Arabs.
0.212121212121212	6	For Kuwait on Thursday, he was a dark knight.
0.0972222222222222	6	Asked the reason for the invasion, Kuwait's ambassador to Washington Sheik Saud Nasir Al-Sabah said at a news conference: Ambition.
0	6	Control of the whole area.
0	6	There is not any reason for it.
0.318181818181818	7	Saudi Arabia, an oil-rich ally of Kuwait, has been subdued in its reaction to Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.
0.0833333333333333	7	The only direct Saudi statement since the invasion was made by an anonymous government spokesman through the official Saudi Press Agency the day after the Iraqi move.
0	7	It did not condemn Thursday's invasion.
0	7	It said Saudi Arabia was following the Kuwait situation with extreme concern and that King Fahd would be seeking to calm the situation and to find a solution in a manner ensuring the interests of all.
0.0707070707070707	7	The only tangible help Saudi Arabia gave the Kuwait government was to shelter members of the ruling family, including the emir, Sheik Jaber al-Ahmed al-Sabah, and his crown prince.
0	7	Both nations are tightly run by royal families.
0	7	The Saudis also allowed them briefly to operate a radio, reportedly from a mobile van in the area around the Saudi-Kuwait border.
0	7	It broadcast calls for resistance to the Iraqis.
0.0569105691056911	7	But on Friday the radio went off the air after a desperate call: The people of Kuwait appeal to you oh brethren, oh Arabs, oh beloved brothers, oh Moslems, rush, rush to their help.

0.232558139534884	0	The remains of the wooden sailing ship were found near the island of Chios in the eastern Aegean at a point where historical accounts place the sinking of the Ottoman ship, according to Peter Nicolaides, a diver and salvage expert.
0.192307692307692	0	The Bourloti Seimaz or Explosives Invincible was set afire and sunk by Greek Admiral Constantine Kanaris in revenge for Turkish killing and looting on Chios.
0	0	Thousands of islanders died in the Turkish raids, which shocked other nations and swung Western European countries behind the Greek struggle for independence from the Ottoman Empire.
0	0	Greece won independence in 1830.
0	0	The French painter Eugene Delacroix produced a famous picture, The Massacre of Chios, based on the raids.
0	0	It's an incredible discovery, straight out of the history book we used to read in school about the War of Independence, Nicolaides said in an interview Friday with The Associated Press.
0	0	Nicolaides, who heard about the wreck while teaching an underwater archaeology course to local divers last winter, started querying fishermen about where their nets snagged on seabed obstacles.
0	0	He pinpointed the wreck on May 3, he said.
0	0	When I dived, I found ships' timbers sticking out of the muddy seabed and dozens of objects Islamic cooking pots, cannon balls, a candlestick, even a chalice from a Greek Orthodox church, he said.
1	0	The ship was obviously crammed with loot from Chios.
0	0	I think there may be gold and silver items as well, he said.
0	0	I also saw what I recognized as human bones, he added.
0.333333333333333	0	He said the wreckage indicated the vessel was at least 100 feet in length.
0.161290322580645	0	According to historians, more than 1,000 people including 400 Greek captives were aboard the ship when Kanaris staged his attack in the early hours of June 7, 1822.

0.441176470588235	1	A freighter carrying a cargo of beer sank in the North Sea today off the Dutch coast and all nine crew members were rescued from life rafts, a coast guard spokesman said.
0.454545454545455	1	The ship sank at about 12:45 p.m. in high winds, some 28 nautical miles north of the island of Ameland.
0	1	It was not immediately clear what had caused the sinking 29 miles off the Dutch island of Ameland, according to the coast guard spokesman, who was not identified.
0	1	There were no casualties, he said.
0.151515151515152	1	The coast guard official, who spoke in a Dutch radio interview, identified the ship involved as the Finnish-registered freighter Ra and said it had been carrying a cargo of beer.
0.454545454545455	1	He did not give the ship's origin or destination.
0	1	The nine crew members boarded two life rafts after the sinking in high winds.
0	1	They were taken ashore by a West German helicopter from the island of Borkum, about 30 miles from the site of the sinking, the official said.
0	1	A Dutch navy aircraft and two life boats also rushed to the scene.
0.3125	1	Earlier reports had said that the ship was a passenger ferry, possibly one of the Dutch ships plying the frequent ferry lanes between the coastal islands and the Dutch mainland.
0	1	Freight shipping in the area is also heavy because of its vicinity to the ports of Delfzijl in the Netherlands and Emden in West Germany.
0.147058823529412	2	Leopold Gratz, the president of Parliament and one of the most powerful politicians in the Socialist Party, resigned today over a scandal surrounding the mysterious sinking of ship 12 years ago.
0	2	Gratz, 59, is the second senior Socialist official to step down because of his alleged involvement in the so-called Lucona scandal, the subject of a widely publicized investigation by a parliamentary committee.
0	2	Interior Minister Karl Blecha, like Gratz a onetime protege of former Chancellor Bruno Kreisky, resigned Jan.19.
0.384615384615385	2	Blecha and Gratz have denied wrongdoing or aiding Udo Proksch, the prime suspect in the sinking of the ship Lucona in the Indian Ocean.
0	2	Six sailors died.
0.227272727272727	2	The Lucona's cargo was officially described by Proksch as for a uranium processing plant and insured for $16 million.
0.185185185185185	2	The insurance company has never paid, claiming the cargo was only scrap metal and alleging the vessel was intentionally sunk to collect the insurance money.
0	2	Proksch, wanted by Austrian justice on suspicion of murder and insurance fraud, has been variously described to be living in Syria, the Philippines and Latin America.
0	2	In several interviews, Gratz described himself as a close friend of Proksch, but when Proksch fled to escape prosecution, Gratz criticized him.
0	2	Gratz told Parliament today he would give up his seat in February, hence his post as president, one of the most prestigious posts in Austria.
0	2	My decision is a personal one and it is politically motivated, Gratz told the house.
0	2	If it becomes impossible for the president to effectively take a stand on significant issues or to speak up on problems of parliamentarism because everybody is only interested in his context in a single other topic, then he cannot serve the National Council in such a way as is his duty.
0	2	In past newspaper stories, Gratz was accused of providing fabricated evidence from abroad to help Proksch in his claim that the controversial shipment was for a uranium processing plant.
0	2	Gratz, who denied the allegations, was also accused of helping Proksch in several other ways.
0	2	Like Blecha, Gratz is to appear before the parliamentary investigation committee.
0.405405405405405	3	An Argentine supply ship that ran aground off Antarctica sank Tuesday in heavy seas and high winds, the government said, and there was concern oil in its hold could leak and damage the environment.
0.405405405405405	3	The sinking of the 400-foot Bahia Paraiso followed warnings from the U.S. National Science Foundation that the unspoiled Antarctic could face ecological disaster if the 250,000 gallons of diesel fuel aboard the ship were to spill.
0	3	No injuries were reported in the sinking.
0.185185185185185	3	Tourists aboard and the crew had been evacuated from the vessel, which was 600 miles south of Cape Horn, the tip of South America.
0	3	Salvage efforts had been hampered by 50 mph winds.
0.227272727272727	3	The double-hulled oceanographic ship sank at about 10 p.m., the government news agency Telam said, citing a navy communique.
0.263157894736842	3	Telam did not say whether the ship broke up or if diesel oil spilled when it went down.
1	3	The depth of the water in which the ship sank was not immediately known.
0.121951219512195	3	The ship had been carrying supplies including jet fuel, gasoline and canisters of compressed gases to the Argentine Esperanza station near the tip of the Antarctic Peninsula, the National Science Foundation said in a statement released in Washington.
0.192307692307692	3	The ship ran aground Saturday about two miles from Palmer Station, a U.S. research facility on the Antarctic Peninsula, the continent's tip.
0	3	It sustained a 35-foot-long gash in its hull, and some of the 250,000 gallons of diesel fuel began leaking, washing ashore near Palmer station.
0	3	The fuel killed some krill, a tiny shrimp-like creature that is a vital part of the Antarctic food chain, and has affected penguins, sea gulls and giant petrel birds, the National Science Foundation statement said.
0	3	There were no immediate details about the extent of damage to the wildlife in the pristine surroundings.
0.4	3	Agency spokesman Jack Renerie said Tuesday before the ship sank that the leak, which was threatening penguins and other wildlife, had stopped.
0	3	Scientists are concerned that some research search projects may already have been affected by the leak, a foundation statement said.
0.357142857142857	3	It said two Argentine salvage vessels were expected to arrive Thursday or Friday.
0	3	Before the sinking, Argentine officials had discounted a spill.
0	3	Telam quoted Argentine navy sources as saying: The fuel it carried, both for itself and the Antarctic stations, was in steel drums so a spill is practically impossible.
0.166666666666667	3	The 316 people aboard the ship when it ran aground, including 82 passengers and 234 crew members, were rescued by power boats and taken to Palmer Station.
0	3	The passengers and most of the crew were taken by cruise ship to the South Shetland Islands, from which they were airlifted to the South American mainland Sunday.
0	3	But 104 crewmen remain at the station, said Renerie.
0	3	Because the station is equipped for only 40 people, food has been rationed to two meals a day, a National Science Foundation statement said.
0.384615384615385	4	Two sailors were missing Monday evening after a 652-foot freighter en route from Greece apparently sank in rough seas 400 miles southeast of Cape Cod.
0	4	Twenty-three crew members were rescued.
0	4	The 23 sailors from the Star of Alexandria were found on a lifeboat and picked up by the merchant ship Ravenscraig, Coast Guard Petty Officer Randy Midgett said in New York.
0	4	They're all in good shape, some minor cuts and scrapes, Midgett said.
0	4	The two missing sailors were believed to be on a life raft, which was the object of a hunt Monday evening by the 950-foot Ravenscraig and five Navy and Coast Guard search planes, officials said.
0	4	The Ravenscraig's crew spotted a second life raft, but it turned out to be empty.
0	4	The cause of the sinking was not immediately known, officials said.
0	4	The Star of Alexandria had been en route from Athens, Greece, to New York with a load of cement when it began taking on water in 12-foot seas and winds up to 35 mph, Midgett said.
0	4	The first mayday call went out at 9:05 a.m.
0.384615384615385	4	A Coast Guard jet from the air station on Cape Cod and a C-130 plane from Elizabeth City, N.C., converged on the ship.
0	4	The lifeboat was spotted around noon.
0	4	The C-130 was able to drop a radio into the water near the boat carrying the 23 crew members and they were able to establish communications, Midgett said.
0	4	About four hours later, they were rescued by the Ravenscraig.
0.25	4	The Star of Alexandria was not spotted, and was presumed to be sinking or sunk, Midgett said.
0	4	Visibility in the rough seas was five to eight miles Monday afternoon.
0	4	The Star of Alexandria was built in 1966, and was registered in England.
0	4	It was designed to carry bulk freight, and was owned by Caribene Investments Ltd. of Gibraltar, according to Bureau Veritas, a Paris-based shipping registry.
0	4	The Ravenscraig had been bound for England, but its destination after its rescue mission was not immediately known.
0.138888888888889	5	A yacht built for Adolf Hitler and sunk with great fanfare to commemorate the Voyage of the Damned was mistakenly dropped on a delicate coral reef in a shallow shipping lane, officials said Tuesday.
0	5	They're going to have to move it, said Coast Guard spokeswoman Veronica Cady.
0	5	The 85-foot Ostwind yacht was supposed to become an artificial reef in 250 feet of water about two miles off the coast.
0.151515151515152	5	It was sunk June 4, 50 years after the U.S. Coast Guard turned away the SS St. Louis as its more than 900 Jewish passengers were seeking refuge from the Holocaust.
0	5	The sinking site was supposed to be near where the Coast Guard intercepted the St. Louis, whose passengers also were turned away by Cuba and forced to return to Europe.
0	5	Most of the passengers later died in Nazi concentration camps.
0.15625	5	For unexplained reasons, the Ostwind was pushed off a barge about a mile north of the site, and is resting in 25 feet of water on a living reef.
0	5	It was truly an incredible, incredible historic event, and suddenly boom!
0.25	5	somebody made a mistake, said Mayor Abe Resnick, a Holocaust survivor and a sponsor of the event.
0.277777777777778	5	Federal and Dade County officials who allowed Resnick to sink the boat are upset about the result.
0	5	They didn't even come close, complained Susan Markely, an administrator with Dade's environmental department.
0	5	Coast Guard Lt. Al Crespo said the yacht is balanced on a delicate living reef, threatening damage to coral and sponges.
0	5	It's also close to an anchoring spot for freighters and other vessels heading to the port of Miami and has been marked with a flashing buoy, he said.
0.238095238095238	5	It's close enough that if a ship swings on its anchor, it could hit it, Crespo said.
0.263157894736842	5	The Army Corps of Engineers said the Ostwind must be moved or cut to pieces by June 22.
0	5	If it's not, the government will remove it and bill Resnick.
0.434782608695652	5	Resnick blames the mistake on A.M. Daly Jr., captain of the tug that towed the yacht to where it was sunk.
0	5	Daly, however, said Chris Cadley, captain of a passenger boat that accompanied him, had agreed to lead him to the site.
0	5	Cadley denied that, saying he only agreed to meet Daly off the coast.
0	5	Resnick said someone will have to pay.
0	5	I think's that's going to end up being decided by attorneys, said Ben Mostkoff, the county's artificial reef director.
0.666666666666667	5	The Ostwind was built at Hitler's direction, although he rarely used it.
0	5	After World War II, the badly decayed boat wound up in the hands of a Jacksonville marina owner.
0.357142857142857	6	A deep-sea inspection of the Bismarck suggests that the most powerful battleship in Adolf Hitler's navy was scuttled by its own crew rather than sunk by the British in a celebrated battle, underwater explorer Robert D. Ballard said Thursday.
0	6	During a 90-minute news conference, Ballard described how he his ocean-crawling robot located the Bismarck sitting upright and proud two weeks ago.
0.178571428571429	6	Then the American oceanographer, whose father was of British background and whose mother was of German heritage, addressed himself to the German people in German.
0	6	I am an underwater explorer, not a treasure hunter, he said, translating himself back into English.
0	6	We found no human remains.
0	6	We touched nothing and took nothing.
0.357142857142857	6	The future of the Bismarck is in the hands of the German people.
0.147058823529412	6	He said he will disclose its exact location only to Germany so Germans themselves can decide whether to try to raise the ship, which sank after a battle May 27, 1941.
0	6	Ballard, a senior scientist at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in Massachusetts, said structural evidence satisfied him that the Germans scuttled the battleship rather than trying to surrender or allowing her to be sent down by British fire.
0	6	Only scuttled ships tend to make it to the bottom in one piece, Ballard said.
0	6	It appears the crew opened it up along its entire length.
0	6	It was clearly flooded, stem to stern.
0	6	Maybe the Germans didn't want it taken as a war prize, he added.
0.138888888888889	6	It is known that two years earlier, Hitler ordered the German pocket battleship Graf Spee scuttled after it was cornered in the neutral port of Montevideo, Uruguay, and attacked by British ships.
0	6	Hitler apparently wanted to keep the British from learning the secrets of the Graf Spee's construction and weapons.
0.111111111111111	6	In the 1941 battle, the Bismarck's main guns were quickly knocked out and the attacking British ships were out of range of her secondary guns, Ballard said, so its was helpless and taking hundreds of hits its sinking clearly inevitable.
0	6	Rendered unsteerable by torpedoes dropped by tiny fabric-covered British biplanes, it was unable to escape.
0.121951219512195	6	Asked if the German commander couldn't have surrendered by ceasing fire, Ballard said in the fuzz of battle in fierce seas it would have been unlikely that the British would have recognized that the Germans were giving up.
0.217391304347826	6	Again, he speculated, perhaps the Germans did not want the ship's technologically advanced equipment to fall into British hands.
0	6	The Bismarck was found by Ballard in more than 15,000 feet of water about 600 miles west of Brest, France.
0	6	He said it was in remarkably good shape, elegant, well preserved.
0	6	Before the battle, British Prime Minister Winston Churchill had left convoys unprotected and thrown all his capital ships in pursuit with a ringing three-word command: Sink the Bismarck!
0	6	Of the Bismarck's 2,200-man crew, only about 115 survived.
0	6	British ships picked up 110 survivors but left with hundreds of German sailors still in the icy waters after spotting what might have been a German U-boat.
0	6	German vessels later rescued only five more survivors.
0	6	The story has been recounted in books, songs and a movie.
0	6	The sinking occurred only eight days after the Bismarck left Gdynia, Poland, for her first operation.
0	6	If unstopped, it could have posed a critical threat to convoys of merchant shipping and undercut British morale at a time when England stood virtually alone against combined German sea and air power.
0.116279069767442	6	The British sent the warship Hood after the Bismarck but within five days of going to sea the Bismarck had sunk the Hood in a three-minute engagement, with the loss of all but three of the vessel's crew of 1,419.
0	6	The Hood was a symbol of British sea power, and its loss stunned the British public and the war government and made sinking the Bismarck a mission of crucial importance.
0.555555555555555	6	Ballard said under laws of the sea, the Bismarck remains the property of the German people.
0.128205128205128	6	The sunken battleship was discovered and photographed by the same remote-controlled robot that Ballard used four years ago to find the wreck of the Titanic, the British passenger liner that sank in 1912 after striking an iceberg.
0.675675675675676	7	A Florida couple said their pleasure boat was sunk by whales off Costa Rica and they survived 66 days at sea by eating raw fish and drinking purified water, the U.S. Coast Guard reported Sunday.
0	7	William Butler, 60, and Simone Butler, 52, of Miami, were weak but recovering at a hospital in Golfito, Costa Rica, after being rescued by a Costa Rican Coast Guard ship Saturday afternoon, said U.S. Coast Guard Chief Petty Officer Egbert Vallecillo.
0	7	The survivors told authorities they lost about 50 pounds each from the ordeal, said Vallecillo, who spoke to the couple by telephone early Sunday.
0	7	The U.S. Coast Guard's Pacific Command is headquartered in Alameda, 10 miles east of San Francisco.
0.344827586206897	7	William Butler told Coast Guard officials their 40-foot pleasure boat Sibonay was attacked and sunk by several whales on June 15 about 1,200 miles southwest of Costa Rica.
0	7	They were large, according to Mr. Butler, Vallecillo said.
0.555555555555555	7	But he didn't know how many whales.
0	7	The couple's last radio contact was June 13, when they talked to their daughter in Miami, the Coast Guard spokesman said.
0	7	Vallecillo said he'd heard of boats running into marine mammals when there's poor visibility, but isn't sure if there are any recorded cases of whale aggression.
0	7	This happened in the early morning hours with good visibility, he said.
0	7	This is the first I've documented.
0.263157894736842	7	As the boat was sinking, the couple said, they grabbed fishing rods and a salt-water purifier and and got into a rubber lifeboat, where they remained for the next two months, Vallecillo said.
0	7	As the lifeboat drifted slowly eastward over two months, the Butlers said, they caught between 400 and 500 pounds of fish and survived multiple shark attacks by sealing punctures with a raft repair kit.
0	7	Butler told U.S. Coast Guard officials that several times the couple spotted merchant ships but were unable to flag them down.
0	7	On Saturday, a Coast Guard ship making its fisheries patrol about 30 miles off the coast of Golfito spotted the raft and rescued the couple.
0	7	They were sailing from Coral Gables, Fla., near Miami, to Honolulu, where they planned to vacation, Vallecillo said.
0	7	Butler is an experienced sailor, he said.
0	7	Their daughter, Sally Smith, and son, Bill Butler, were flying to Costa Rica on Sunday evening to be reunited with their parents, Vallecillo said.
0.104166666666667	8	BFN Buenos Aires, 23 May Today, the Foreign Ministry said that control operations carried out by the corvette Spiro against a Korean-flagged received] ship fishing illegally in Argentine waters were carried out accordance with international law and in coordination with the Foreign Ministry."
0	8	The Foreign Ministry thus approved the intervention by the Argentine corvette when it discovered the Korean ship Chin Yuan Hsing violating Argentine jurisdictional waters on 21 May.
0	8	The Argentine Navy reported today that the corvette Spiro stayed near the Korean ship the adverse weather conditions, and fulfilling its responsibilities of sea search and rescue."
0.333333333333333	8	The Korean ship, which had been fishing illegally in Argentine waters, was sunk by its own crew after failing to answer to the Argentine ship's warnings.
0	8	The crew was transferred to the Chin Chuan Hsing, which was sailing nearby and approached to rescue the crew of the sinking ship.
0	8	The Navy reported that around 15 nautical miles off the coast of Malvinas and accordance with bilateral agreements with Great Britain, the Spiro transferred assistance responsibility to British authorities."
0.217391304347826	8	The Foreign Ministry said understanding with the UK for operations in cases of uninterrupted persecution of illegally fishing ships was implemented."
0	8	The Foreign Ministry also said the policy in accordance with the growing international opinion currently giving priority to the preservation, regulation, and the sustainable use of marine live resources and the effective punishment of violators of national laws on the matter."
0	9	Ferries are among the safest vessels afloat.
0.303030303030303	9	But, as the tragic sinking of the Estonia with the loss of more than 800 lives demonstrates, when they do go down the toll in human life can be high.
0.217391304347826	9	As ferries increase in size, so the numbers on board at risk from mechanical failure or a crew error go up.
0.1	9	The move to roll-on roll-off ferries with vehicle decks which run the entire length of the vessel has increased the risk that, once the sea penetrates the hold through the bow doors or a gash in the ship's side, it can lead to the vessel capsizing.
0	9	The United Nations International Maritime Organisation and its members, the ship-owning nations, have devoted much thought over the past two decades to ship safety.
0.3125	9	But the sinking of the Estonia should lead to a new review of ferry safety.
0.166666666666667	9	Particularly worrying are the eyewitness reports which suggest that water penetrated the bow doors in a manner reminiscent of the sinking of the Herald of Free Enterprise in 1987.
0	9	Unlike the Herald, the Estonia appears to have had its doors closed, but ro-ros are undoubtedly very vulnerable to water penetration.
0	9	Any review of ferry safety should focus on three main issues.
0	9	First the subject of ferry design should be reconsidered.
0.192307692307692	9	Additional stability could be provided by the addition of sponsons, stabilising bulges which project from the ship's side just above the water line.
0	9	Greater resistance to an influx of water could be obtained by installing moveable barriers or bulkheads to break up the large car decks.
0.227272727272727	9	These proposals were looked at by the British government in the wake of the sinking of the Herald of Free Enterprise.
0	9	It calculated that it would cost between Pounds 70m and Pounds 85m to improve standards on the 57 vessels in the UK ferry fleet, with a further Pounds 22m in extra annual running costs.
0	9	Higher costs would inevitably lead to higher fares unwelcome to ferry operators when, on the short cross-Channel routes, they face competition from the Channel tunnel.
0.227272727272727	9	But the difficulty of pushing through fare rises would be nothing like as damaging to the ferry companies as another disaster.
0	9	Second, the IMO and national governments must look closely at how to improve enforcement of existing regulations.
0	9	The IMO has been trying to move enforcement up its agenda, but it depends on the good will and professionalism of governments and shipowners.
0	9	Third, the IMO should be given support by national governments in its campaign, launched yesterday, to improve crew training.
0.294117647058823	9	Much of the regulation in recent years has concentrated on improving the ship and its equipment.
0	9	Above all, if new regulation does turn out to be necessary, it must be introduced speedily.
0	9	As things stand, it can take years before changes are ratified by enough governments to give them force.
0	9	The European Union, which Sweden and Finland are getting ready to join, could take a lead in speeding up the process.
0.3125	9	Ship safety is not, of course, just an issue for the ferry sector.
0	9	Five ferries were lost last year, according to Lloyd's Register.
0	9	But this figure pales into insignificance compared with the 96 general cargo ships and 12 tankers which also went down.
0	9	When a cargo vessel with a third-world crew goes down in a distant ocean, very little attention is paid.
0.375	9	If the loss of a relatively modern passenger vessel in European waters can make shipping safety a higher priority for governments and the public, this will be some small compensation for the loss of life from the Estonia.

Economic confusion surrounds the mysterious death of publishing magnate Robert Maxwell . Maxwell , who put together a publishing empire following his immigration to Britain in 1940 , was found dead off the coast of the Canary Islands after apparently having fallen overboard from his yacht .

0.135802469135802	1	ABOUT 20 banks became con-cerned last summer at the behaviour of businesses run by Robert Maxwell several months before he died and his business empire collapsed.
0.183333333333333	1	Their concern arose when Maxwell Communication Corporation made late payments to them, a Financial Times investigation has discovered.
0	1	Yet although some banks became alarmed at the implications for the financial health of his empire, they did not discuss their concerns with each other or with authorities such as the Bank of England.
0	1	Mr Basil Brookes, MCC's former finance director, has described his shock to the FT at discovering last August that MCC had failed to settle foreign currency transactions with about 20 banks on time.
0.444444444444444	1	Starting about July 4 1991, MCC's treasury, under the authority of Maxwell and his son, Kevin, had begun to buy and sell enormous amounts of foreign currencies.
0.698412698412698	1	In these transactions, MCC would buy a currency in one financial centre promising to make payment in another centre.
0.305555555555556	1	On a number of occasions, MCC received the currency, but did not make the payment thereby giving itself an unauthorised loan.
0.709677419354839	1	Mr Brookes says about 20 banks, including Lloyds, Bank of America, Goldman Sachs and Swiss Bank Corporation, were involved in the flurry of foreign exchange deals.
0	1	At least Dollars 100m in unapproved credit is thought to have been raised this way.
0	1	A former Maxwell employee said some appeared to have been channelled into private Maxwell businesses.
0	1	One banker said attempts to raise money by making late payments in the foreign market was a relatively well-known ruse with the nickname called and lading'.
0	1	It also emerged yesterday that National Westminster Bank, the biggest lender to the Maxwell private companies, felt badly let down by Maxwell because he failed to deliver funds on time at the end of July.
0	1	At a meeting between Maxwell and Mr John Melbourn, a NatWest director, on July 10, NatWest refused Maxwell's request for a loan of Pounds 45m.
0.094017094017094	1	NatWest was upset three weeks later when it provided funds less than Pounds 100m to the Maxwell empire on the understanding that it would be repaid the same day, and then found that repayment was not made.
0	1	NatWest was forced to convert this transaction into a short-term loan, which was eventually repaid.
0.192982456140351	1	The bank told both Robert Maxwell and Mr Kevin Maxwell that it was concerned that repayment had not been made, but it did not discuss the problem with other banks or with the Bank of England.
0	1	Instead, it pressed on with its policy of reducing the size of its loans to the Maxwell businesses.
0	1	NatWest's loans to the Maxwell empire now total Pounds 182m, half the level of two years ago.
0.523809523809524	1	Later last year, Robert Maxwell made many repayments to banks by looting pension fund assets and also carrying out unusual fundraising exercises with US investment banks, from which tens of millions of dollars were borrowed at a high price.

0.333333333333333	2	DOCUMENTS which show for the first time that both Mr Robert Maxwell and his son Kevin were intimately involved in substantial purchases of shares in Maxwell Communication Corporation, one of their own public companies, have been obtained by the Financial Times.
0.345911949685535	2	Meanwhile, a director of a secretive Swiss trust, Mr Werner Rechsteiner, has broken his silence and has admitted that transfers of MCC shares to his trust, which are at the centre of an investigation by the Serious Fraud Office, were made on the instructions of Robert Maxwell.
0	2	This is the first time that Mr Rechsteiner has given details of the relationship between his mysterious trust, Yakosa Finanzierungs, and the Maxwell family.
0.0873015873015873	2	The FT has also obtained a letter and has seen a corroborating fax which shows that Mr Kevin Maxwell was intimately involved in the purchase of 9m shares by Yakosa and a further 16m shares by Servex, another Swiss Trust.
0.261904761904762	2	The MCC purchases by Yakosa and Servex are the object of an investigation by the SFO into an alleged illegal scheme to support the MCC share price.
0.236559139784946	2	The SFO is also investigating whether Mr Robert Maxwell or Mr Kevin Maxwell breached the Companies Act by failing to disclose the purchases of the shares by the Swiss trusts.
0.126436781609195	2	If either had a financial interest in the Swiss trusts, the purchases should have been disclosed under company law, because they were both directors of MCC.
0.094017094017094	2	The documents demonstrate that Bishopsgate Investment Trust, a private UK company controlled by the Maxwell family, provided Pounds 55.33m on behalf of the two Swiss trusts so that they could pay for the MCC shares.
0.733333333333333	2	Goldman Sachs, the US investment bank, acted as broker to the deals.
0	2	Goldman's lawyers are convinced that it acted properly.
0.135802469135802	2	Mr Rechsteiner yesterday broke the silence he has maintained since Robert Maxwell's death in November on the subject of his relationship with the Maxwell family.
0	2	He said MCC share purchases had been on for some time' through Yakosa.
0	2	He denied that the shares were bought for Yakosa's account'.
0	2	He said the shares were bought for other and then for a certain time.'
0.107843137254902	2	He also stressed that ownership of the MCC shares no longer rested with Robert Maxwell once they had been received by Yakosa: is owned by the Maxwell Foundation,' he said.
0.135802469135802	2	Mr Rechsteiner refused to say who controlled the Maxwell Foundation, which is based in Liechtenstein, but said it was neither Robert nor Kevin Maxwell.
0.215686274509804	2	The FT has however obtained documents showing that Mr Kevin Maxwell was closely involved in the process of paying for 25m MCC shares on behalf of two Swiss trusts, Yakosa and Servex.
0.2	2	On May 29 last year, Mr Kevin Maxwell sent a fax to Mr Larry Wood, an executive director of Goldman Sachs, telling him that two parcels of 12.5m MCC shares each would be bought by the Swiss trusts with Pounds 55.33m provided by BIT, a Maxwell private company.
0.20952380952381	2	The fax, signed by Mr Maxwell, said that the funds would be remitted to Goldman Sachs Bishopsgate Investment Trust PLC from its account at National Westminter Bank plc, 41 Lothbury'.
0.0990990990990991	2	Two other faxes sent by Mr Kevin Maxwell to Mr Wood on the same day show that the former was equally involved in the other end of the transaction, the sale of the 25m shares.
0.523809523809524	2	The Swiss trusts bought the shares, using Goldman as broker, from two Maxwell pension funds, Maxwell Communication Pension Trustee and Mirror Group Newspaper Pension Trustee
0.159420289855072	2	Each pension fund sold 12.5m shares at a price of 219.78p a share, or Pounds 27.47m in total.
0.293333333333333	2	At 6.29pm on May 29, Mr Maxwell sent the two other faxes to Mr Wood on behalf of the two pension funds.
0.255813953488372	2	As a director of MGPT and as a trustee of MCCPT, he told Mr Wood to pay each pension fund what it was owed to the NatWest account of BIT, which Mr Maxwell described as for the two pension funds.
0.0990990990990991	2	In other words, he told Mr Wood that the shares were being bought for the Swiss trusts with funds provided by BIT and that these funds should then be sent by Goldman back to BIT.
0.159420289855072	2	In the event, on May 31, Goldman received the Pounds 55.3m by wire transfer in its account at Barclays.
0	2	Goldman then levied its commission and expenses on the deal of Pounds 385,000 and wired the remainder back to BIT's NatWest account.

0.126436781609195	3	THE LATE Mr Robert Maxwell liked to think of himself as a chess player and there was always a chess set in his suite in his London headquarters.
0.143790849673203	3	is no evidence to suggest that Maxwell actually was a strong player or that he played in any tournaments,' said Mr Malcolm Pein, international chess master and director of Chess and Bridge, which yesterday took over the business and assets of Maxwell Macmillan Chess and Bridge.
0.174603174603175	3	There may be doubts about Robert Maxwell's strength as a player but less about his enthusiasm for the game.
0.174603174603175	3	In 1990, through The European newspaper, he sponsored a section of the World Chess championships in New York.
0	3	And when Pergamon was sold to Elsevier last year Maxwell kept the chess and bridge publishing businesses.
0.104761904761905	3	Mr Pein said it had taken most of the year since Mr Maxwell's death to prise the businesses, which include Chess Monthly and Bridge Monthly from the administrators to the Maxwell empire.
0	3	Waterhouse took months and months to come up with any information about the company,' said Mr Pein.
0.289473684210526	3	Even when the new company had reached agreement to buy the business from Price Waterhouse, administrator to the public Maxwell companies they then ran into trouble with Arthur Andersen, administrator to the private Maxwell businesses.
0	3	Mr Pein said the new company wanted to use and pay for the premises of Maxwell Macmillan Chess and Bridge prefabricated buildings in the village of Wheatley, Oxfordshire until they found permanent premises.
0	3	However, he said that Arthur Andersen wanted two years back rent.
0	3	Despite the year of difficulties, Chess and Bridge is now set up in new premises in Euston Road, London.
0	3	The company said it had the largest collection of chess and bridge books and products in the UK.
0.203703703703704	4	Sir Nicholas Lyell QC, the attorney-general, will attempt to stop the curtain rising on Maxwell: The Musical, the West End show chronicling the life and times of the late Robert Maxwell.
0.458333333333333	4	Fears that the musical might prejudice the criminal trial of the late publisher's sons, Kevin and Ian, have prompted Sir Nicholas to apply to the High Court on Monday for an injunction to halt the production.
0	4	The musical tells the tycoon's life story through updated versions of familiar tunes from Gilbert and Sullivan.
0	4	Now in rehearsal, the show is due to open at London's Criterion theatre on February 11.
0	4	The attorney-general's move to close down a West End production before its first night is regarded as without precedent.
0.0691823899371069	4	However, it is no more unprecedented, most lawyers say, than the prospect of the Maxwell brothers having to commute to their trial at the Old Bailey past a theatre advertising the story of their father as musical review that will make you laugh, sing and be angry'.
0	4	The musical, which has cost Pounds 1.1m to put on, has been produced by Mr Evan Steadman, a former chairman of one of Maxwell's private companies.
0	4	Mr Steadman indicated yesterday he intended the show to go on and that the attorney-general's application for an injunction would be contested.
0	4	However, he said he was leaving matters in the hands of his lawyers.
0	4	Press coverage of the late publisher since his death has already caused deep concern to the Maxwell brothers' lawyers
0.174603174603175	4	Mr Alun Jones QC, Kevin Maxwell's barrister, led calls for reporting restrictions to be placed on a recent High Court ruling that Robert Maxwell had been fraudulent in his dealings with shares in Berlitz, the publishing company.
0.126436781609195	4	Turning down his request, the judge asked him: it going to be your client's defence that Mr Robert Maxwell was not guilty of misappropriation?'
0	4	At that point, lawyers in court themselves fell about laughing.
0.366666666666667	5	Two writs have been filed alleging that Goldman Sachs, the US-based investment bank, assisted in diverting Pounds 55m from two pension schemes controlled by Robert Maxwell to ensure its own debts from Maxwell interests would be repaid.
0.122222222222222	5	The writs were filed late last week in the State Supreme Court in Manhattan by trustees for Mirror Group Newspapers Pension Scheme and Maxwell Communication Corpora-tion Works Pension Scheme.
0	5	The trustees seek more than Dollars 100m for the sale of shares plus interest, commission charges and punitive damages from Goldman and Mr Eric Sheinberg, partner in charge of international equities trading.
0.188034188034188	5	The writs centre on the purchase of Pounds 55m of MCC shares from the pension schemes by two Swiss trusts, Servex and Yakosa, which were transacted through Goldman and for which the schemes were never paid.
0.523809523809524	5	The writs allege Goldman was aware the trusts were controlled by Robert Maxwell.
0.138364779874214	5	The writs also allege that on May 28 1991 the same date Mr Kevin Maxwell arranged for the pension fund share transaction to be paid for Goldman was due to receive Dollars 58.2m for an unrelated transaction selling MCC stock to an unnamed American lawyer close connections to Robert Maxwell'.
0.183333333333333	5	The writs claim that Goldman was directly with its customer, the pension fund trustee, for payment'.
0.146666666666667	5	On April 26 1991, they say, Mr Kevin Maxwell told Mr Sheinberg to sell the pension scheme shares to the Swiss trusts.
0	5	On May 23 he told Goldman to remit the proceeds of the sale not to the pension schemes but to Bishopsgate Investment Trust, which Goldman knew or should have known was controlled by the Maxwell family.
0.0780141843971631	5	The writs allege that after the deal was struck Mr Trevor Cook, MGN pension fund administrator, told Goldman that proceeds of the sale should be paid to the pension scheme, but when Mr Kevin Maxwell ordered the proceeds to be paid to BIT.
0.152777777777778	5	The writs say that Goldman and Sheinberg no reasonable effort to determine who had actual authority to direct for the pension fund that the shares be sold and where the more than Dollars 47m in proceeds from the transfer of the 12.5m shares should go'.
0	5	Goldman said it had no money or other benefit from these transactions other than its brokerage commissions of Pounds 110,000 which were substantially less than the amount of the applicable stamp duties paid to the Inland Revenue of Pounds 215,000'.
0.950617283950617	6	British media entrepreneur Robert Maxwell said Monday that he is involved in negotiations to buy a U.S. newspaper valued the hundreds of millions of dollars."
0.323529411764706	6	Maxwell declined to identify the newspaper, but his comments prompted industry speculation that it might be Gannett's USA Today, Tribune Co.'s New York Daily News or the Chicago Sun-Times.
0.261904761904762	6	Officials of each of those newspapers denied that they were negotiating with Maxwell.
0.198198198198198	6	Maxwell's comments were made to reporters at the annual meeting in New York of Maxwell's Berlitz International and were confirmed later by a spokesman for Maxwell Communications, the investor's London-based holding company.
0	6	The spokesman declined to elaborate on the remarks, and said Maxwell had left the United States.
0.107843137254902	6	The Daily News has one of the United States' largest circulations, but in recent years it has struggled to restore profitability and maintain circulation in a market with three other dailies.
0	6	The paper is conducting difficult labor contract negotiations with its unions.
0	6	Some analysts said it might make sense for Maxwell to try to purchase USA Today, since it would mesh well with his efforts to print and distribute his month-old English-language paper, The European, in this country.
0	6	Maxwell has already been in negotiations with USA Today officials about printing the paper for U.S. distribution.
0.114583333333333	6	Other industry officials conjectured that Maxwell might be talking to the Chicago Sun-Times, which has seen daily circulation slide more than 100,000 papers, to about 533,000, since 1985.
0.458333333333333	6	Maxwell, who publishes Britain's Daily Mirror, recently bought three U.S. supermarket tabloids, the Globe, National Examiner and the Sun, for an estimated $100 million.

0.114583333333333	7	His mysterious death came as Maxwell was embroiled in an international controversy, something common in a life that had the improbable, extravagant and sometimes mysterious character of British fiction.

The Bombay Stock Exchange ( BSE ) remains open following a week of onslaught . First the Securities and Exchange Board of India accused the market of ignoring and failing to enforce rules .

0.085	0	All this has taken place against a volatile background: the Bombay equity market, over the past six weeks or so, has had to contend first with unusually bullish speculation, before the national budget on February 27, and subsequently with some savage expressions of disappointment.
0.202380952380952	0	Dr Manmohan Singh, the Indian finance minister, disappointed traders in the budget at the end of last month.

0	0	He lowered the tax to 30 per cent from 65 per cent for expatriate Indians and foreign investors but for local investors it remained at 44.5 per cent.
0	0	Taking the tax concessions for granted, traders had driven up share prices in February to make a kill later.
0	0	Instead, the budget turned out to be a nightmare.
0	0	While industry and business welcomed the statement which, for once, did not propose any new tax, Professor Rusi Taraporewala, the stock market theorist and academic, said a reduction in import duties would leave corporate profits ex-growth this year.
0.386363636363636	0	The relative lack of financial concessions meant that disappointed traders sold with a vengeance and, until the weekend, the market seemed bottomless as equity prices plummeted to a 13-month low.

0.197674418604651	1	The identity of the bombers was unknown but the explosion comes just five days after over 250 people were killed and at least 1,200 injured in a series of bomb attacks aimed at the heart of the Indian business capital of Bombay.
0.621951219512195	1	A militant Sikh group fighting for independence for the Indian state of Punjab has claimed responsibility for the Bombay blasts, but police are unconvinced, saying they were carried out by a foreign group in connivance with criminals'.
0	1	In what many interpreted as a reference to Pakistan, with whom India has fought three wars, last week Mr Shankarrao Chavan, the federal home minister, told parliament in New Delhi that he suspected international conspiracy.'
0	1	Most of the estimated 125 people living in the Calcutta flats were in their beds when the blast occurred, setting fire to both buildings, according to officials in the city's central control room.
0.303571428571429	1	At least 45 people were dead on arrival at hospital, they said.
0.85	1	Last Friday a series of car bombs exploded in Bombay in what the government described as a systematic attack on India's commercial heart.
0.490384615384615	1	Among the targets were the Bombay Stock Exchange, the landmark Air India building, a shopping complex, and two hotels near the airport.
0.141666666666667	1	The attacks in Calcutta and Bombay are a severe setback to attempts to heal the wounds created by recent intercommunal violence, which has caused deep shock throughout India.
0.265625	1	More than 2,000 people died in riots, including over 700 in Bombay, after the razing of a mosque at Ayodhya in northern India by Hindu zealots on December 6.
0.31875	1	Some fear the wave of bomb attacks is designed to stir a renewal of communal strife and undermine efforts by the government of Mr P V Narasimha Rao to open up the economy and attract foreign investment and tourism.
0	1	Last night national and local state leaders appealed for calm in an attempt to prevent a renewed outbreak of violence.
0	1	Mr Rao urged the nation to ignore rumours after the and criminal blast'.
0.354166666666667	2	MR TEG BAHADUR Thapar was serving lunch from his stall outside the Bombay stock exchange on Friday when he was showered with flying glass and broken concrete in one of 13 explosions which rocked the city and left at least 255 people killed and over 1,200 injured.
0	2	lucky to be alive,' he said from his hospital bed.
0	2	Who can stop this happening again?'
0	2	Across Bombay people were asking themselves the same questions this weekend.
0	2	They sensed there was an enormous difference from the riots which scarred the city in December and again in January.
0	2	Those were caused by a traditional mix of crime, political agitation and ancient Hindu-Moslem hatreds stirred by the destruction of the mosque in Ayodhya.
0	2	The weapons used were mostly primitive knives, clubs and petrol bottles.
0	2	Friday's outrage, by contrast, bears the deadly stamp of high-technology terrorism, complete with Semtex plastic explosive, high-grade timers, efficient organisation and money.
0	2	The only comparable previous incident was the assassination in 1991 of Mr Rajiv Gandhi, the former prime minister, by Sri Lanka's Tamil Tiger terrorists.
0.53125	2	But that was a single bomb aimed at one man the explosions in Bombay were designed to terrorise the nation's commercial capital.
0.772727272727273	2	Bombay accounts for 35 per cent of India's exports.
0.202380952380952	2	Mr P V Narasimha Rao, the prime minister, described the blasts as an attack on India's economy.
0	2	The immediate assumption both at the highest level and in the streets of Bombay was that those responsible must have been foreigners or had foreign help.
0.379464285714286	2	But these suggestions were seen in Bombay as a deliberate attempt to deflect attention from the people who in the popular mind are the real suspects Moslem extremists who might have taken revenge for the riots which hit India after the Ayodhya mosque's destruction and which left 2,000 dead, including 700 in Bombay.
0.146551724137931	2	If Moslems are found to have staged the attacks, the Indian authorities will certainly suspect that the operation was supported from a Moslem country, notably Pakistan.
0	2	The implications would be vast.
0	2	Breaking diplomatic relations would be the minimum step Delhi could take on a dangerous road.
0	2	Mr Rao chose his words carefully during his visit to Bombay: is a definite possibility that our search may not stop within the country.
0	2	I do not want to name anybody because it will have ramifications within and outside the country.'
0.265625	2	There is no evidence linking the attacks to Moslem extremists, let alone to Pakistan.
0	2	Even if Moslem groups are found to be responsible for the bombings, they could have been supplied from other Moslem countries.
0	2	India would still face a diplomatic crisis but hardly on the same scale.
0	2	For the moment, such concerns seem remote from the streets on Bombay, where the atmosphere yesterday was calm.
0.5	2	Workmen were clearing away rubble at the blast sites, including the blackened stock exchange building.
0	2	Bombayites seemed determined to put the outrage behind them.
0	2	At the Gymkhana Club and dozens of other sports grounds, hundreds of men and boys were playing cricket as they do every Sunday.
0.283333333333333	2	Others were walking along the seafront by the arch of the Gateway of India.
0.163461538461538	2	The stock exchange authorities plan to re-start trading as soon as they can today using an old trading floor the exchange vacated only last year.
0	2	Businessmen estimated the main loss to the city would be the loss of life and injuries and the damage caused to blasted buildings.
0	2	They did not expect the same widespread disruption to production as occurred during the riots.
0	2	Some of the credit for the limited disruption should go the government and the police for promptly calling paramilitary and regular troops to help patrol sensitive districts.
0	2	But much more should go to the people of Bombay, who, so far at least, have refused to be goaded into violent protest by the bombers.
0.257575757575758	3	THE INDIAN government flew federal paramilitary troops into Bombay last night after more than a dozen bombs exploded in the city, killing about 200 people and injuring more than a thousand.
0.894736842105263	3	The devices, mostly car bombs, appeared to be a systematic attack on India's commercial heart.
0	3	All exploded within 90 minutes in the afternoon.
0.490384615384615	3	Among the targets were the Bombay Stock Exchange, the landmark Air India building, a shopping complex, and two hotels near the airport.
0.114864864864865	3	The identity of the bombers was unknown, but the attacks were a severe setback to India's attempts to heal the wounds created by recent intercommunal violence, which has caused deep shock throughout India.
0.265625	3	More than 2,000 people died in riots, including over 700 in Bombay, after the razing of a mosque at Ayodhya in northern India by Hindu zealots on December 6.
0.242857142857143	3	The bombs appeared designed to stir a renewal of communal strife and to undermine efforts by the government of Mr PV Narasimha Rao to open up the economy and attract foreign investment and tourism.
0	3	One of the targets was close to the headquarters of Shiv Sena, a Hindu nationalist party accused of fomenting violence during the riots, in which most victims were Moslems.
0	3	National and local state leaders appealed for calm in an attempt to prevent a renewed outbreak of violence.
0	3	Mr Rao urged the nation to ignore rumours after the and criminal bomb blasts'.
0	3	Mr Sharad Pawar, the former federal defence minister just re-appointed chief minister of Maharashtra state, said all roads into Bombay had been blocked and the army put on alert.
0	3	He said: is aimed at disrupting the economy and it appears a conscious effort because only Bombay seems to be the target.'
0	3	Mr Shankarrao Chavan, the federal home minister, told parliament in New Delhi: suspect an international conspiracy.'
0	3	The Indian High Commission in London said the attacks were of the externally supported terrorism which has targeted India for some time'.
0.265625	3	However, Indian officials stopped short of directly accusing Pakistan, the country's arch-enemy.
0.137096774193548	3	The bomb attacks were spread throughout the city and were clearly aimed at the city's better-off business people in contrast to the riots in which victims were mainly poor.
0	3	At the 28-storey stock exchange building, about 3,000 people were on the second-storey trading floor when a bomb exploded in the underground car park, hurling shards of glass across the floor and into the street.
0	3	Some victims were crushed in the stampede to escape.
0	3	Outside, burned bodies lay among litter from shattered buildings.
0.932926829268293	4	A ROW has erupted between the Bombay stock exchange, India's largest stock market, and the Securities and Exchange Board of India, the securities watchdog, over the board's recent first-ever inspection of stockbrokers' books.
0.141666666666667	4	The Sebi has accused stockbrokers of flouting the exchange's rules, including regulations on margin trading designed to limit the risk of members defaulting through excessive speculative investments.
1	4	It has also accused the exchange authorities of failing to enforce rules and of poor administration.
0	4	The stock exchange denied the allegations, saying they were made out of context and blown out of proportion.'
0.53125	4	The argument will do nothing to restore investors' faith in the stock market where, as measured by the Bombay stock exchange's 30-share index, shares have fallen 48 per cent from their peak early last year, including a 320 points fall since the government's budget was announced two weeks ago.
0	4	Yesterday the index closed at 2330.
0	4	Foreign investors, who are being wooed by India as a source of much-needed capital, will also be concerned at the latest allegations of poor management at the exchange.
0.0787037037037037	4	In one of its most damaging passages, the inspectors' report alleges that D S Prabhoodas, a leading firm headed by Mr Hemendra Kothari, a former BSE president, and by Mr Jaswant Chotalal, a member of the BSE's governing body, avoided margin payments totalling Rs185.4m
0	4	Mr Kothari said yesterday that most of the transactions covered by the report were off-exchange deals directly between financial institutions for which margin payments were not required.
0.2125	4	Mr M R Mayya, the BSE's executive director, said BSE rules permitted such bilateral off-exchange transactions.
0.326923076923077	4	Sebi also accused the exchange of mismanaging the administration of its building.
0	4	This week's argument is only the latest in a series of disputes which began almost as soon as Sebi started operations a year ago.
0.2125	4	It was established by Mr Manmohan Singh, the finance minister, as a crucial element in financial reform.
0.653846153846154	4	Brokers claim the Sebi is heavy-handed and fails to understand their needs.
0	4	They say rules must be applied flexibly and many firms are extremely small and unable to carry the cost of extra regulations.
0	4	But the finance minister is backing Sebi to the hilt and singled it out for praise in his recent budget speech.
0.296511627906977	4	Finance ministry officials believe loose regulations allow brokers and others to dodge taxes and also contributed to last year's securities market scandal in which banks, including the UK's Standard Chartered Bank, lost a combined gross total of Rs40bn.

0	8	Hang the murderers, scores of young men chanted as they marched in front of a jeep bearing the battered body of Karna Hyanju, once a sympathizer of the now-outlawed Communist Party.

0.180555555555556	8	He died Friday at the Bir hospital in Katmandu, 7 miles west of Bhaktapur.
0	8	Uttam Dhaubanjar, a 28-year-old bank employee and neighbor of the dead man, said Hyanju had been handing out blankets, milk and other food in Bhaktapur when he was accosted by a group of men who accused him of giving relief supplies only to his own supporters.
0.298850574712644	8	Reports of damage and devastation continued to arrive from remote parts of Nepal on Friday, and the Home Affairs Ministry updated its confirmed death toll to 704.

0	8	He said many belonged to the same Communist faction that Hyanju once supported.
0	8	People started beating him with umbrellas, Dhaubanjar said.
0	8	There were a lot of scratches on his body, and a lot of blood.
0	8	It looked like one ear was missing.
0	8	Then they made a necklace of their shoes put it around his neck and pulled him through the streets.
0	8	As Hyanju's body was taken through the winding streets of Bhaktapur, a 12th-century town of ancient Hindu temples, thousands of the town's 50,000 people jammed streets, temple steps and the balconies of brick and mud houses.
0	8	Pashupati Rana, one of several Cabinet ministers who marched in the funeral procession, said several people were arrested in the killing, including the mayor, the deputy mayor and a member of the Rashtriya Panchayat, or non-partisan assembly.
0	8	Rana, who is minister of local development and legislative, affairs, called Hyanju's death political murder.
0	8	Hyanju served in the Panchayat from 1981 until 1986 when he lost the backing of the Communists in Bhaktapur, traditionally a leftist stronghold.
0	8	The Panchayat, whose members are elected on non-party lines, was created after the late king Mahendra abolished the old Parliament and all political parties in 1960, saying a Western-style parliamentary system was not suited to his mountain kingdom.
0	8	Dhaubanjar and a group of young men who gathered around him said Hyanju was perceived as a government supporter despite his previous communist leanings.

The shuttle Discovery soared into space to launch its history-making payload , the $ 1.5 billion Hubble Space Telescope . While orbiting at 380 statute miles above Earth , it will provide astronomers worldwide with 10 times better resolution and 25 times more sensitivity than ground-based observatories . The telescope 's release from the shuttle Discovery was delayed because a solar power panel took three tries before it fully unfurled . Once released , ground controllers were unable to link up the telescope 's two high-gain antennas with their assigned relay satellite . However , scientists , optimistic that the Hubble will soon be operational , authorized the shuttle Discovery crew to return home .

0.17825311942959	1	Five astronauts boarded Discovery today for a second try at sending the Hubble Space Telescope into orbit to scan the outermost reaches of the universe for clues to the beginning of time.
0.105042016806723	1	Astronomers are starting to tingle again in anticipation of what the Hubble will be able to accomplish, said Lennard Fisk, head of NASA science activities.
0.0525210084033613	1	Air Force forecasters said there was a 90 percent chance the weather would be favorable for launching the shuttle at the scheduled time of 8:31 a.m. EDT.
0	1	More than a half million gallons of liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen were pumped into the space ship's fuel tanks after midnight.
0	1	The astronauts, wearing bright orange flight suits, climbed into the crew cabin just as dawn was breaking over the Kennedy Space Center.
0.113122171945701	1	The $1.5 billion telescope, NASA's costliest cargo, will give astronomers a new set of eyes and ears that we don't have, said William Lenoir, head of NASA's space flight program.
0	1	It's going to change our perspective altogether.
0	1	I can't say what we're going to learn, but I'll be astounded if we don't learn many new things.
0.294117647058824	1	Discovery was aiming for an altitude of 380 miles, the highest a shuttle has ever gone, so the telescope can be placed in its proper orbit far above Earth's distorting atmosphere.
0	1	It is the 35th shuttle mission.
0.0334224598930481	1	Columbia, which journeys into space next month with the Astro observatory, sat on a launch pad 1.6 miles from Discovery, only the second time both pads have been occupied; the first was in 1986 just before the Challenger explosion.
0	1	Hubble has been waiting to take its place in space since 1983, delayed by technical problems and the Challenger accident.
0.108932461873638	1	The latest postponement occurred April 10, when Discovery's launch was scrubbed four minutes before liftoff because of a faulty power unit on the shuttle.
0	1	The mood at the Kennedy Space Center was considerably less festive than during the first launch attempt, when hundreds of astronomers gathered with their families.
0.176470588235294	1	The day after launch, mission specialist Steven A. Hawley will use the shuttle's mechanical arm to lift the 24,250-pound telescope into space.
0.0980392156862745	1	Veteran spacewalkers Bruce McCandless II and Kathryn Sullivan will assist if a problem develops.
0.105042016806723	1	Discovery will follow Hubble from 40 miles away for two days until after its lens cap is opened, exposing the finely polished 94.5-inch mirror to starlight.
0.0773993808049536	1	Hubble is not expected to start providing scientific data by satellite for a month or more after liftoff.
0	1	However, NASA said it will release its first image an open star cluster in the constellation Carina a week after launch.
0.189753320683112	1	In addition to the $1.5 billion cost of Hubble, $500 million has been spent on spare parts, astronaut training and computer software to operate the instrument.
0	1	The European Space Agency contributed $250 million for 15 percent of the viewing time.
0.232198142414861	1	NASA estimates it will cost $200 million a year to operate and maintain the telescope in space.
1	1	During its 15-year working lifetime, the telescope will provide astronomers with 10 times better resolution and 25 times more sensitivity than ground-based observatories.
0	1	As a result, they will be able to study stars and galaxies so distant their light has been traveling toward Earth for 14 billion years.
0	1	Astronomers hope to learn whether the universe was created 15 billion years ago as believed and uncover some of the mystery surrounding galaxies, black holes and quasars.
0	1	Hubble also is expected to shed light on how and when the universe might end.
0.127877237851662	1	The telescope is named for the late astronomer Edwin P. Hubble, who discovered during the 1920s that the universe is expanding.
0	1	His work gave rise to the Big Bang theory that the universe was created by a tremendous explosion.
0.200534759358289	1	In addition to Hubble, Discovery carries a human skull filled with sensors to measure the space radiation that astronauts receive.
0.294117647058824	1	It is the skull's third trip into space.
0.0773993808049536	1	The shuttle is to end its five-day mission with a landing at Edwards Air Force Base, Calif.
0.122549019607843	2	Seven years late, the Hubble Space Telescope is where it belongs, out of this world and in search of others so distant that they may have been formed at the beginning of time.
0.315126050420168	2	Less than five hours after it rode into space aboard the shuttle Discovery on Tuesday, the $1.5 billion telescope sent its first test radio signal.
0	2	At the sign of life, applause and cheers erupted in Mission Control in Houston.
0.0773993808049536	2	As near as we can tell, everything looks perfect, said astronaut Steve Hawley from the shuttle.
0.154798761609907	2	Hawley's job on Wednesday will be to drop the telescope overboard for a 15-year stay in space.
0.173010380622837	2	Discovery, trailing an arc of white smoke into a brilliant blue sky, carried the silver-colored telescope to an orbit 380 miles above Earth higher by 70 miles than any previous shuttle.
0.122549019607843	2	There the Hubble will stay to search for yet-unseen wonders of creation with instruments that can look 14 billion years backward in time.
0	2	Our window on the universe!
0	2	NASA launch commentator George Diller exulted as the Discovery rose off its seaside launch pad.
0.137867647058824	2	It's a beautiful day to have Hubble Space Telescope in orbit instead of here on Earth like it's been for so many years, said NASA administrator Richard Truly.
0	2	Hubble's in its element and I'm delighted.
0.0700280112044818	2	The telescope was supposed to be launched in 1983, but technical problems and the Challenger accident delayed its deployment.
0.108932461873638	2	It suffered a further delay two weeks ago when the countdown was stopped at the four-minutes-to-go point because of a faulty hydraulic unit on the shuttle.
0.210084033613445	2	While it remained on Earth, the telescope cost $7 million a month to exercise and keep in readiness.
0	2	In its first day in space, that checkout and testing continued remotely under control of the Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland.
0.0397456279809221	2	On hand to watch the Discovery launching was a contingent of scientists who have hailed the Hubble as the greatest advance in astronomy since Galileo raised a small telescope to his eyes nearly 400 years ago.
0.0639386189258312	2	Truly referred to the early-day astronomer when he was asked about the long delays in getting the telescope to its working station.
0	2	Somebody the other day said, remembers the day that Galileo picked up his telescope to look at the stars?'
0	2	said Truly, a former shuttle astronaut.
0.0816993464052287	2	It doesn't matter what day we launch Hubble, it matters that we do it right.
0.0700280112044818	2	The telescope is 43 feet long and 14 feet in diameter, about the size of a railroad tank car.
0	2	When it flies free, it will receive electrical power for its six scientific instruments from two wing-like solar arrays that extend outward on each side.
0.0445632798573975	2	It is named after the late astronomer Edwin P. Hubble, who theorized that the universe was expanding and that the farther away a galaxy is, the faster it is traveling.
0	2	That gave support to the theory that a massive explosion the Big Bang created the universe 10 to 20 billion years ago.
0.147058823529412	2	The Hubble is expected to help provide the answer to two major questions: How old is the universe?
0	2	How big is it?
0.0865051903114187	2	The telescope has two mirrors, one 94.5 inches in diameter, the other 12 inches.
0	2	Two of the instruments are cameras, two are spectrometers and one is a photometer.
0	2	In addition, the fine pointing system acts as a sixth instrument by providing precise measurement of distances.
0.0326797385620915	2	On Wednesday, Hawley is to grapple the 12{-ton telescope with the shuttle's mechanical arm, lift it out of the cargo bay, point it, and after a long checkout drop it overboard to orbit on its own.
0.210084033613445	2	In the cargo bay, the telescope receives electrical power from the shuttle.
0	2	But the juice is cut when the instrument is lifted out and it will depend on internal batteries until the solar panels are extended to receive light from the sun.
0	2	Should the solar panels not deploy, mission specialists Bruce McCandless and Kathryn Sullivan will be standing by, partially dressed in space suits, ready to go into the open cargo bay to unfurl the arrays manually.
0.163398692810457	2	Discovery's launch was not without its problems.
0	2	With 31 seconds left in the countdown, the computer that runs the final moments before liftoff refused to close a fuel valve and stopped the launch process.
0.0773993808049536	2	The problem was overcome and the shuttle lifted off at 8:34 a.m. EDT, about three minutes late.
0.0773993808049536	2	The shuttle is scheduled to land Sunday at 9:49 a.m. EDT at Edwards Air Force Base in California.
0.0588235294117647	2	On the way uphill, as Commander Loren J. Shriver put it, the shuttle's windshield was splattered with several flecks of things.
0	2	He said the windshield was streaked by the debris and that it also was smeared when the spent booster rockets fell off during the climb to orbit.
0	2	The astronauts also had problems with their UHF radio circuit, and one of the ship's small rear thrusters was inoperative.
0	2	Neither problem was considered serious.
0.226244343891403	3	After years of delay and a last-minute snag, the Hubble Space Telescope was freed from the shuttle Discovery on Wednesday and, glinting in the sunlight, drifted into orbit on its 15-year search for new worlds.
0.196078431372549	3	Mission specialist Steven Hawley released Hubble from the end of the shuttle's 50-foot-long mechanical arm after a delay in getting one of the telescope's solar wings unfurled.
0.113122171945701	3	The first of NASA's great observatories is now on station at 330 nautical miles above the Earth, Mission Control's Jeffrey Carr said.
0.050709939148073	3	The telescope really looked great as we flew away from it, and we sure hope it does good work, Discovery commander Loren J. Shriver said later.
0.23719165085389	3	The $1.5 billion telescope was released at 3:38 p.m. EDT as the shuttle entered its 20th orbit of Earth, nearly two hours and one orbit later than planned.
0.245098039215686	3	The shuttle then backed away.
0	3	Thank you very much for the ride, said Mike Harrington, director of orbital verifications at Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md.
0.0588235294117647	3	Mission specialists Bruce McCandless and Kathryn Sullivan had been in the shuttle's airlock, ready to walk inspace to free the solar panel.
0	3	That proved to be unnecessary.
0.0700280112044818	3	Close but no cigar, but better for the Hubble that it went the way it did, Sullivan said.
0	3	She and McCandless had trained for nearly five years to make such a rescue mission.
0.142314990512334	3	The first solar array unreeled from its mast at midday Wednesday as the shuttle passed 380 statute miles, or 330 nautical miles, above South America's eastern coast.
0.154798761609907	3	It started providing power to the telescope's batteries, which otherwise had only eight hours of charge.
0	3	Deployment of the starboard panel, however, was more troublesome.
0.0612745098039216	3	It wouldn't budge when latches were first released, then moved about a fifth of its 39-foot length, and stopped again.
0	3	A third attempt rolled the panel out all the way.
0	3	Houston, we see motion, Commander Loren J. Shriver reported.
0.0794912559618442	3	Hawley began the long process of releasing Hubble shortly after 7 a.m. EDT when he grasped it with Discovery's 50-foot-long mechanical arm and carefully hoisted the 12{-ton telescope high above the shuttle.
0.0565610859728507	3	Hubble was taken off shuttle electrical power just before it was lifted out of the cargo bay and was operating on its own nickel-hydrogen batteries.
0.0612745098039216	3	At one day, seven minutes into the flight of Discovery, Hubble is now on its own internal power, Carr said.
0	3	The game has begun.
0	3	The race is on.
0	3	The clock is ticking.
0.140056022408964	3	Worries that the telescope's instruments would be starved for electricity eased after the first solar panel was stretched out.
0.0490196078431372	3	Television cameras aboard Discovery showed the first array as it was pulled from its reel slowly but steadily, the sun reflecting off the gold-colored panel and silvery telescope.
0.490196078431372	3	Discovery was 380 statute miles above Earth, 70 miles higher than any shuttle has ever flown.
0.326797385620915	3	The orbit was dictated by the need to put the telescope above the Earth's distorting atmosphere.
0.441176470588235	3	Discovery's five astronauts were awed by the view.
0	3	I'd like to pass on the quote of the day from the on-board astronomer something to the effect that the big marble sure looks far away today, Shriver said of Hawley.
0.105042016806723	3	Astronomers have waited seven years for Hubble to take its place in space.
0.0700280112044818	3	The telescope originally was scheduled for launch in 1983, but technical problems and the Challenger explosion pushed it back.
0.0816993464052287	3	The mission was delayed another two weeks when a faulty power unit on Discovery forced the National Aeronautics and Space Administration to halt the first launch attempt four minutes before April 10's scheduled liftoff.
0.0700280112044818	3	On Tuesday, Discovery finally blasted into space, transporting Hubble out of this world and in search of others.
0.140056022408964	3	The telescope's 10-foot aperture door is to be opened Friday, exposing the finely polished 94.5-inch mirror to starlight.
0.226244343891403	3	Discovery was following Hubble in case the door does not open properly.
0.0816993464052287	3	If a problem develops, McCandless and Sullivan will be prepared once again to walk in space.
0.0565610859728507	3	Fred Wojtalik, Hubble project manager, said the telescope would be tested Thursday for its ability to maneuever before the aperture door is opened.
0.0525210084033613	3	We want to be in full control so we don't ever endanger the Hubble by putting the aperture door close to the sunlight, he said.
0.0865051903114187	3	The telescope cannot focus into the sun because of the sensitivity of its five instruments.
0	3	If all goes well, the crew will land Sunday at Edwards Air Force Base, Calif.
0.0668449197860963	3	NASA expects to release its first image from the telescope of an open star cluster in the constellation Carina on Tuesday.
0	3	Data will follow in a month or two.
0	3	Astronomers hope to look back to almost the beginning of the time, studying stars and galaxies so distant their light has been traveling to Earth for 14 billion years.
0	3	They expect to determine precisely how and when the universe was formed, currently estimated at 15 billion years ago.
0.122549019607843	3	The telescope is named for the late American astronomer Edwin P. Hubble, who discovered during the 1920s that the universe was expanding.
0	3	He also was responsible for helping to form the Big Bang theory of creation.
0.285947712418301	4	Ground controllers at the Goddard Space Flight Center finally made contact today with the two main antennas on the $1.5 billion Hubble Space Telescope after trying for more than six hours to lock on.
0.0544662309368192	4	Applause erupted in the Hubble control center in Greenbelt, Md., as the glitch that marred Hubble's first full day in space was solved.
0.0544662309368192	4	We have confirmation that we have achieved communication with the Tracking and Data Relay Satellite through the high-gain antenna system, said NASA's Dave Drachlis.
0	4	Engineers had said all along they believed the antennas were working all right and that the problem was in incorrectly pointing either the satellite or the TDRS, an orbiting communications satellite that acts as a switchboard.
0	4	In the successful attempt, they nearly doubled the width of the antennas' beams to take in more territory, from a sweep of 6.2 degrees to 10.8 degrees.
0.108932461873638	4	The telescope's low-gain antennas, which receive and transmit information at a much slower rate and can be used in emergencies, were working well.
0.210084033613445	4	Space shuttle Discovery was 46 miles away, available to remedy certain problems.
0	4	The outage was not a problem for which space walkers would have been summoned.
0.140056022408964	4	The five astronauts were otherwise busy making pictures of storms over Texas from their 380-mile-high perch, and doing experiments.
0.0490196078431372	4	Steve Terry, director of a team calibrating various aspects of the telescope, said the first outage was caused by human error and was not a serious problem.
0	4	It began between 1 and 1:30 a.m. EDT and lasted 45 minutes to an hour, he said.
0.235294117647059	4	The second failure occurred at 6:44 a.m. when controllers attempted to send a signal to the telescope's two high-gain antennas through the TDRS.
0	4	This time it was a pointing problem, said Jim Elliott, a Goddard spokesman.
0	4	It's a new spacecraft and we think inexperience dealing with it was the cause.
0.126050420168067	4	The telescope, embarking on a 15-year search for new worlds, was released from the shuttle's cargo bay Wednesday after a last-minute snag that almost sent two astronauts on an emergency spacewalk.
0	4	Mission Control awakened the crew early today with a loud rendition of the song Shout, a fraternity house favorite.
0	4	Good morning, Discovery.
0.0919117647058823	4	I guess you're awake after that song, said Kathy Thornton, shuttle communicator.
0	4	There are a lot of happy people down here.
0	4	We saw a great deploy yesterday and Hubble had a good night while you were asleep.
0	4	We appreciate the good words from everybody, replied Discovery Commander Loren Shriver.
0.0735294117647059	4	After Wednesday's deployment, Shriver gently backed Discovery away from the telescope and put the shuttle through a series of maneuvers, the last one completed this morning, to park Discovery in orbit 46 miles behind Hubble.
0.0588235294117647	4	The telescope really looked great as we flew away from it, and we sure hope it does good work, Shriver said Wednesday.
0	4	Well, it sure is now, Loren, and thanks for all the great work you've done, replied Mission Control.
0	4	Galileo is real proud of you.
0.047438330170778	4	Scientists have hailed the Hubble NASA's most expensive unmanned spacecraft as the greatest advance in astronomy since Galileo raised a small telescope to his eyes nearly 400 years ago.
0.152129817444219	4	Discovery and its five astronauts will follow the telescope while controllers at the Goddard center make sure Hubble is operating properly, such as responding to directional commands.
0.108932461873638	4	The next milestone is Friday, when the telescope's 10-foot aperture door is to be opened, exposing the finely polished 94.5-inch mirror to starlight.
0.0612745098039216	4	Then on Tuesday, NASA expects to release the first image from the telescope: an open star cluster in the constellation Carina.
0	4	Data will follow in a month or two.
0.0565610859728507	4	If the aperture door doesn't open properly, Discovery could return to the telescope so two astronauts could perform a spacewalk to fix it.
0.0612745098039216	4	Hubble project manager Fred Wojtalik said the telescope would be tested today for its ability to maneuver before the aperture door is opened.
0.0525210084033613	4	We want to be in full control so we don't ever endanger the Hubble by putting the aperture door close to the sunlight, he said.
0.267379679144385	4	Too much light could damage the telescope's sensitive instruments.
0.047438330170778	4	On Wednesday, mission specialist Steve Hawley used the shuttle's 50-foot robot arm to gently grasp the 12{-ton telescope and hoist it from the cargo bay.
0.183823529411765	4	One of the telescope's solar arrays unreeled from its mast as expected and started providing power to the telescope's batteries, which otherwise had only eight hours of charge.
0	4	But there was trouble with the second panel.
0.0612745098039216	4	It wouldn't budge when the latches were released, and then moved about a fifth of its 39-foot length and stopped again.
0	4	The panel rolled all the way out on the third attempt.
0	4	By the final attempt, astronauts Bruce McCandless and Kathryn Sullivan were in their space suits in the airlock, 30 minutes away from taking tools in hand and going on an outer-space maintenance call.
0	4	Wojtalik said the cause of the problem is unknown.
0.255754475703325	4	The 8{-hour procedure was performed 380 miles above Earth, 70 miles higher than any shuttle has ever flown.
0.346020761245675	4	The orbit was dictated by the need to put Hubble above the Earth's distorting atmosphere.
0.0432525951557093	4	Astronomers hope to use the telescope to look back to almost the beginning of the time, studying stars and galaxies so distant their light has taken 14 billions years to reach Earth.
0	4	They hope to determine how and when the universe was formed, currently estimated at 15 billion years ago.
0.147058823529412	4	The telescope originally was scheduled for launch in 1983 but was delayed by technical problems and the Challenger accident.
0	4	Discovery, which blasted into orbit Tuesday, is scheduled to land Sunday at Edwards Air Force Base, Calif.
0.285947712418301	5	The shuttle that put the Hubble Space Telescope into orbit also carries an instrument used in the 1920s by astronomer Edwin Hubble: the eyepiece from what once was the world's most powerful telescope.
0.0717360114777618	5	It's a great pleasure to have something of such historical significance and something that so directly symbolizes Edwin Hubble's fundamental contributions to astronomy, astronaut Kathy Sullivan said Friday as she circled the Earth in space shuttle Discovery.
0	5	The eyepiece from the Mount Wilson Observatory's 100-inch Hooker Telescope was carried into orbit by Sullivan.
0.154798761609907	5	After she brings the eyepiece back to Earth, it will be placed on display at the observatory.
0	5	It's basically a symbolic gesture from the past of astronomy to the future of astronomy, said Lyn McAfee, spokeswoman for the Mount Wilson Institute.
0	5	The Pasadena-based group runs the observatory, located in the San Gabriel Mountains outside Los Angeles.
0	5	The discoveries made by Hubble on the 100-inch telescope at Mount Wilson gave us a giant leap forward in our understanding of the universe, McAfee said.
0.367647058823529	5	We believe the Hubble Space Telescope will do the same thing.
0	5	The Hooker Telescope was the world's most powerful telescope from its construction in 1918 until 1948, when the 200-inch Hale Telescope was placed in operation at Mount Palomar Observatory northeast of San Diego.
0.0525210084033613	5	Using the Hooker Telescope, Hubble was the first to determine the distance to a galaxy outside the Milky Way, the institute said in a statement.
0	5	This crucial discovery provided the first definite proof that other galaxies existed far beyond the confines of our own local galaxy, the institute said.
0	5	During the 1920s and 1930s, Hubble and an assistant used the Hooker telescope to take thousands of photographs of faint galaxies, showing that most of them were moving away from each other very quickly.
0	5	This provided observational evidence for the concept, suggested by Einstein's Theory of Relativity, that the universe is expanding, the institute said.
0	5	Hubble's work helped convince scientists the universe was created in a giant explosion, called the big bang, an estimated 15 billion years ago.
0	5	The Hooker Telescope was mothballed in 1985 by the Carnegie Institution, former operator of the observatory, in a money-saving move.
0	5	The institute hopes to obtain funds to reopen it.
0.158982511923688	6	The Hubble Space Telescope was awakened from its self-induced sleep today but it was still without the use of its high-speed antennas, and its science instruments were on hold, unable to begin any observations.
0.140056022408964	6	We are out of the right now, said Steve Terry, a supervisor of the engineers controlling the telescope.
0.0612745098039216	6	He said the telescope was running on a normal control-all mode, where its own computers and sensors guide where it is pointing.
0.094876660341556	6	Discovery's astronauts, meanwhile, packed their gear for a return to Earth Sunday, made some last-minute observations of Earth and talked with ground-based reporters about their flight.
0.0408496732026144	6	Pilot Charles Bolden said he was especially upbeat about the widespread public awareness of the telescope, which is expected eventually to look back 14 billion light years nearly to the birth of the universe.
0.200534759358289	6	It's hard to go somewhere and find someone who has never heard of the Hubble Space Telescope, said Bolden.
0	6	It makes little kids' eyes light up.
0	6	It makes little kids want to learn how to add and subtract and study science.
0.204248366013072	6	The telescope's big eye has remained open, but Hubble had been in a safe mode with all motion stopped because of earlier problems in linking the high-speed dish antennas with a relay satellite.
0	6	The antennas are the primary links for relaying scientific data to the ground.
0.0358680057388809	6	Terry said that even in the safe mode, one of the tape recorders in the telescope reads telemetry signals from all its systems and that these would be played to Earth and analyzed when the antennas are working properly.
0	6	We expect to use that data to investigate what happened, he said.
0.0420168067226891	6	Engineers are able to send commands to the telescope via its secondary antennas but the communications system is not useful for scientific data, which must be transmitted at a high rate of speed.
0	6	We're putting the scientific instruments in a hold mode, in effect a standby mode, he said.
0.0312891113892365	6	Shortly after 6 a.m. EDT, controllers at the Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md., completed a series of commands that took the telescope out of its safe mode and then began to run a 12-hour computer program to monitor Hubble's health.
0.126050420168067	6	It will take another day before the $1.5 billion telescope is operating the way it was supposed to at this point in the startup process, said Hubble deputy project manager Jean Olivier.
0	6	We're backing up to a very deliberate and slow and careful approach to these problems, Olivier said Friday.
0	6	This is not the time to do anything dumb.
0.262605042016807	6	The telescope problems have put the flight center several days behind, but the five astronauts who deployed it earlier this week were sticking to their schedule.
0.0525210084033613	6	Landing is scheduled for 9:48 a.m. EDT Sunday at Edwards Air Force Base, Calif., but flight controllers were keeping a close watch on the weather.
0	6	Winds were predicted to be about 20 mph with gusts up to 29 mph.
0	6	Mission rules dictate that headwinds cannot exceed 29 mph at touchdown.
0.154798761609907	6	The shuttle carries enough supplies to stay in orbit three days beyond Sunday if necessary, NASA said.
0	6	Mission Control awakened the crew members at about 1:30 a.m. EDT today by playing the song, Cosmos.
0	6	Thanks for the wake-up music, it's pretty appropriate for today, said Commander Loren Shriver.
0.117647058823529	6	The song was selected in honor of Hubble Space Telescope, which is now open for business, said Mission Control commentator James Hartsfield.
0.163398692810457	6	The astronauts were to finish up their experiments and photography today and pack for the trip home.
0	6	They also planned to hold a news conference from space with reporters at the Johnson Space Center.
0.0490196078431372	6	Shriver and pilot Charles Bolden were to run through a series of tests to make certain the shuttle's computers and control jets were ready for return to Earth.
0.0612745098039216	6	The crew deployed Hubble on Wednesday but they had stayed close to the telescope in case there was trouble opening the aperture door.
0.169683257918552	6	Mission specialists Bruce McCandless and Kathryn Sullivan were prepared to perform a space walk today to crank it open in orbit 380 miles above Earth.
0.108932461873638	6	But that proved unnecessary when the door was opened Friday morning, exposing the telescope's finely polished 94.5-inch eye to starlight for the first time.
0	6	Two of Hubble's four position-stabilizing gyroscopes stopped working when the door opened, but engineers later got them back on line.
0.0459558823529412	6	The gyroscopes were knocked out by the motion and that, too, kept the telescope in the safe mode, said Dave Drachlis, director of orbital verifications at Goddard.
0	6	A colleague, Steve Terry, said Hubble's systems were set at conservative limits for the first operations and that caused many malfunctions.
0	6	There also were two communications outages totaling several hours.
0.0445632798573975	6	Hubble is designed with safe modes so it can be the master of its own destiny in case contact with an orbiting communications system is lost for extended periods, Terry said.
0.0588235294117647	6	NASA had planned to release its first test image from the telescope on Tuesday, showing an open star cluster in the constellation Carina.
0.226244343891403	6	But Terry said that would be delayed because of the antenna problems.
0	6	Scientific data will follow in a month or two.
0.126050420168067	6	The telescope, named for the late astronomer Edwin P. Hubble, will enable astronomers over its 15-year working lifetime to look back 14 billion years and possibly determine the age of the universe.
0	6	The universe is believed to have been created about 15 billion years ago in a cosmic explosion.
0	6	Hubble provided the basis for the big-bang theory of creation.
0.0544662309368192	6	He discovered during the 1920s that the universe is expanding and that the farther the galaxy is from Earth, the faster it is moving away.
0.367647058823529	7	Countdown clocks resumed ticking Saturday for the shuttle Discovery's delayed launch Tuesday to boost the $1.5-billion Hubble Space Telescope into orbit.
0.163398692810457	7	Engineers also readied the shuttle Columbia for rollout to its launch pad today for a May flight.
0.133689839572193	7	Discovery's carefully scripted countdown began on time at 3 p.m.
0	7	The ship's five-member crew is set to blast off at 5:31 a.m. PDT Tuesday, 14 days after the flight was grounded just four minutes before takeoff by a faulty hydraulic power steering unit.
0	7	off and running," NASA spokesman George Diller said.
0	7	still 80% go for launch weather-wise."
0.0700280112044818	7	With Discovery's launch processing on track, engineers worked to ready Columbia for its May 16 Spacelab astronomy mission.
0	7	The National Aeronautics and Space Administration has not had two shuttles on the launch pad since Columbia took off Jan. 12, 1986, with Challenger poised on a pad 1.7 miles away.
0	7	Columbia's 3.5-mile trip to the firing stand was set to begin at 8 a.m. today.
0.0544662309368192	7	Five hours later, Discovery's five-member crew was scheduled to fly in from the Johnson Space Center in Houston to make final preparations for launch.
0.0754147812971342	7	Commander Loren J. Shriver, 45; co-pilot Charles F. Bolden, 43; Steven A. Hawley, 38; Bruce McCandless, 52, and Kathryn D. Sullivan, 38, plan to launch the telescope Wednesday.
0.157563025210084	7	Discovery's replacement auxiliary power unit was successfully test fired Wednesday and the battery charging for the telescope was completed Thursday, one day ahead of schedule.
0.050709939148073	8	The space shuttle Discovery brought a thundering end to years of frustration when it blasted off Tuesday to extend human vision to the very edge of the universe.
0.117647058823529	8	The Discovery roared to a record high orbit of 381 miles, where its crew today will ever-so-carefully deploy the Hubble Space Telescope, billed as the finest optical instrument ever created, a $1.5-billion scope that is half a billion times more powerful than the human eye.
0.089126559714795	8	Seven years behind schedule, the telescope will be deployed by astronaut Steven Hawley, an astronomer, on a day that many scientists were beginning to doubt they would ever see.
0	8	been long and frustrating," conceded Edward Weiler, program scientist for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, who was visibly shaken by the launch.
0	8	astronomer," he said softly, take today off."
0	8	The launch marked the beginning of an era some say a revolution in the exploration of the universe.
0	8	12 years," astronomer Eric Chaisson of the Space Telescope Science Institute said with a sigh, has finally left the Earth."
0.304259634888438	8	High above the haze of the Earth's atmosphere, the Hubble is expected to produce images 10 times sharper than even the largest telescopes on Earth today.
0.0773993808049536	8	The telescope will not get down to serious science until it completes a seven-month checkout and engineering period.
0	8	Then scientists will begin studying some of the dimmest and most distant objects in the universe.
0.140056022408964	8	After the deployment, engineers at the Goddard Space Flight Center will begin the tedious process of activating the telescope.
0	8	Although scientific images that should tell much about the origin and evolution of the universe will not be released for several months, there will be a few teasers early on.
0.0773993808049536	8	In about seven days the Hubble should snap its first picture what astronomers call light" for the telescope but it will be primarily an engineering exercise and the image is not expected to amount to much.
0	8	The image, of a cluster of stars in the southern sky, will be taken during the beginning of the focusing phase, so it may not even be in focus.
0	8	But it will still represent a historic moment.
0.101419878296146	8	stars may be so out of focus they look like doughnuts," said Caltech's James Westphal, principal scientist for the telescope's wide field camera.
0	8	however it comes out, it's going to be great."
0	8	It will mark the moment when humans freed themselves from the fuzzy view from Earth and looked to the heavens with absolute clarity.
0	8	There will be other space telescopes in the years ahead, but there will never be another moment quite like this.
0	8	bit of 12 years was worth it," Weiler said moments after Discovery lifted off on a sunny day, pierced a fleecy white cloud and emerged on the other side like a spacecraft on a journey to the future.
0	8	Sadly, some who have worked so hard for so long were forced to miss the launch.
0.119236883942766	8	They were here two weeks ago, but when the launch was delayed because of a hydraulic problem they returned to their homes, and many agencies had not budgeted for two trips to Cape Canaveral.
0	8	Weiler estimated that only about one-third of the people who were here April 10 made it back for Tuesday's launch.
0	8	Among the missing were most of the families who had accompanied scientists in hopes of seeing this little bit of history.
0	8	There was only one small snag in the otherwise perfect launch when a valve failed to close automatically, halting the countdown at 31 seconds before launch.
0	8	The valve was ordered by computer to correct its position, and it did so, clearing the way for the countdown to resume.
0	8	That delayed the launch about four minutes.
0.0525210084033613	8	But at 5:34 a.m. PDT, with Air Force Col. Loren J. Shriver, 45, sitting in the commander's seat, the shuttle lifted off.
0.490196078431372	8	All five members of the crew are veterans of previous flights.
0	8	This is the second flight for Charles F. Bolden Jr., 43, the pilot, and mission specialists Bruce McCandless, 52, and Kathryn D. Sullivan, 38.
0	8	It is the third flight for Hawley, 38.
0.122549019607843	8	Sullivan and McCandless will be partially suited for a spacewalk today just in case anything goes wrong during the deployment of the telescope.
0	8	The most anxious moments will come as Hawley gently lifts the 25,000-pound instrument out of its tight quarters in the cargo bay.
0.133689839572193	8	He will do that with the shuttle's robotic arm, which he tested in the first hours of the flight.
0.0432525951557093	8	The arm, however, tends to drift slightly, so he will have his hands full keeping the telescope from banging into the sides of the payload bay as he lifts it.
0.183823529411765	8	Engineers will not breathe freely until the telescope's two giant solar arrays are unfurled.
0.117647058823529	8	The solar arrays keep the telescope's high-tech batteries charged, and if they are not fully deployed within six hours after the telescope is lifted out of the cargo bay, the batteries will have discharged to the point that some instruments in the telescope could be damaged.
0.154798761609907	8	So Sullivan and McCandless will be ready to step outside and manually unfurl the solar arrays if necessary.
0.101419878296146	8	After the telescope is released and functioning on its own, the Discovery will back off about 40 miles and shepherd the scope around Earth for two days.
0.105042016806723	8	If anything goes wrong during that period, the shuttle can rendezvous with the telescope and McCandless and Sullivan can go out and work on the problem.
0	8	If there are no problems, Discovery will land at 6:49 a.m. PDT Sunday at Edwards Air Force Base.
0.133689839572193	9	The Discovery astronauts triumphantly launched the $1.5-billion Hubble Space Telescope one orbit late today after last-ditch commands from Earth freed a stuck solar panel, narrowly averting a daring emergency spacewalk.
0.210084033613445	9	The telescope began orbiting Earth every 97.3 minutes at an altitude of 380 miles high above the atmosphere, which has limited the view of ground-based telescopes.
0.0919117647058823	9	go for Hubble release," Mission Control told the crew at 12:37 p.m. PDT.
0.133689839572193	9	The event occurred a minute later as the shuttle slowly and carefully backed away as the telescope, glinting in the sunlight, drifted off on its 15-year search for new worlds.
0.157563025210084	9	The final hours before its release were a nightmare for ground controllers as they commanded the unfurling of two solar panels that power the telescope's instruments.
0	9	The starboard panel balked twice as it was being pulled from its reel.
0	9	Mission Control ordered spacewalking astronauts to be ready to go out of the cabin to help.
0	9	But there was a third try, and it was successful.
0.0612745098039216	9	have confirmation that the solar array wing on the starboard side has been deployed," the telescope control center in Maryland said.
0.0980392156862745	9	we have good news," said Dave Drachlis of the Hubble control center.
0.101419878296146	9	The deployment of the two 39-foot panels allowed sun power to flow into the telescope's batteries, relieving worries that they would use up their eight-hour charge.
0.0700280112044818	9	Before astronaut Steve Hawley was able to lift the 12 1/2-ton telescope from the cargo bay with the shuttle's mechanical arm, its instruments had to be disconnected from the shuttle's power and shifted over to the batteries.
0	9	Astronauts Kathryn Sullivan and Bruce McCandless had put on spacesuits and entered an air lock in order to be ready to walk outside and pull out the array in case mechanical deployment of the solar panels failed.
0.191815856777494	9	The first solar array unreeled from its mast at midday as the shuttle passed 380 miles above South America's eastern coast.
0.154798761609907	9	It started providing power to the telescope's batteries, which otherwise had only eight hours of charge.
0	9	Deployment of the starboard panel, however, was more troublesome.
0.0639386189258312	9	It refused to budge when latches were first released, then moved about a fifth of its 39-foot length and stopped again.
0	9	A third attempt rolled the panel out all the way.
0	9	we see motion," Commander Loren J. Shriver reported.
0.119236883942766	9	Hawley began the long process of releasing Hubble shortly after 4 a.m. PDT when he grasped the Hubble with Discovery's 50-foot-long mechanical arm and carefully hoisted the 12 1/2-ton telescope high above the shuttle.
0.432525951557093	9	Discovery was 380 miles above Earth, 70 miles higher than any shuttle has ever flown.
0.326797385620915	9	The orbit was dictated by the need to put the telescope above the Earth's distorting atmosphere.
0.441176470588235	9	Discovery's five astronauts were awed by the view.
0	9	like to pass on the quote of the day from the on-board astronomer something to the effect that the big marble sure looks far away today," Shriver said of Hawley.

0.151515151515152	4	Last year's Booker winner was Kazuo Ishiguro for his novel, The Remains of the Day.
0.0413223140495868	4	Television executive Sir Denis Forman, chairman of the judge's panel, announced the prize at a banquet in London's Elizabethan Guildhall, seat of the city's Lord Mayor.
0.0454545454545455	4	There was very strong individual support for several books on the short list and finally by A.S. Byatt was the winner by a majority vote, said the judges.
0.0439882697947214	4	The panel was unanimous, however, in agreeing that the standard of the other five novels was exceptionally high and this made their decision unusually interesting and unusually difficult.
0.0454545454545455	4	Ms. Byatt, who earlier this month won the $43,000 Irish Times-Aer Lingus prize for international fiction for the same work, has published five novels since 1964.
0	4	In Possession, she tells how two graduate students piece together the relationship and lives of two imaginary Victorian poets from fragments of their letters and by retracing the poets' journeys across England and to France.
0	4	The influence of the past on the living is a theme throughout the book.
0	4	Ms. Byatt, born in 1936, is the daughter of a lawyer and sister of novelist Margaret Drabble.
0	4	Her first novel, Shadow of a Sun, concerned the efforts of a woman to escape the shadow of her novelist father.
0	4	A 1978 work, The Virgin in the Garden, makes allegorical allusions to Shakespeare and other English literary geniuses in a tale of a play performed at a country house.
0	4	Ms. Byatt taught English and American literature at University College in London until 1983, when she quit to write fulltime.
0.0272727272727273	4	Other finalists this year were 1979 Booker Prize winner Penelope Fitzgerald with The Gate of Angels, Irish novelist John McGahern's Amongst Women, Canadian-born Mordecai Richler's Solomon Gursky Was Here, Brian Moore's Lies of Silence, and Beryl Bainbridge's An Awfully Big Adventure.
0	4	They were chosen from a list of 113 books published in the United Kingdom in 1989.
0.743801652892562	4	The Booker Prize is sponsored by Booker, an international food and agriculture business, and administered by The Book Trust.
0.170454545454545	4	It is Britain's top literary award.
0	5	THE annual Booker ballyhoo got going again yesterday when the judges for this year's Pounds 20,000 prize for British fiction announced the shortlist.
0.189393939393939	5	The Prize is no longer the richest literary award but it guarantees great prestige, and sales, for the winner, and, say its admirers, helpfully brings The Novel to public attention.
0	5	Its critics say that the autumn brouhaha distorts the annual fiction industry and the intense media hype of the shortlisted authors does a disservice to the hordes of other gifted but unlisted writers.
0	5	This year's shortlist contains no surprises.
0.0401069518716578	5	London's litterati have for weeks been betting on Michael Ondaatje's The English Patient those of them who have seen a proof copy because it is not officially published until next week.
0	5	Last night the bookmakers William Hill made it the 5-2 favourite.
0	5	The shortlist is: Serenity House by Christopher Hope
0	5	Black comedy by a master South Africa-born specialist in the trade.
0	5	Set in a Highgate refuge' where euthanasia is an unspoken word and its senior citizen, Max Montfalcon, turns out to be a geriatric Nazi scientist.
0	5	The FT review next Saturday will describe it as farce
0	5	The Butcher's Boy by Patrick McCabe
0	5	An Irish murderer, a soft-in-the-head orphan jailed for life, recalls his life in grisly detail.
0	5	The FT reviewer said that misery and deprivation of working class life have never been so brutally evoked
0	5	Black Dogs by Ian McEwan
0	5	McEwan's fiction is uniquely disturbing some would say deliberately offensive.
0	5	He is the novelist of misanthropy.
0	5	This is the tale of a failed marriage, episodically told, and the black dogs of evil are both metaphorical and literal.
0	5	The English Patient by Michael Ondaatje
0.0332594235033259	5	The Sri Lankan poet and novelist Ondaatje, who lives in Canada, has followed the skin of a lion' with an extraordinary book about four characters in a Tuscan villa in the closing months of the last war.
0	5	The central metaphor is bombs disposal of, and then Hiroshima.
0	5	The patient' is a central mystery around which the others' stories orbit: he fell out of the sky in flames; who is he?
0	5	The FT review on Saturday will hail it as a masterpiece.
0	5	Daughters of the House by Michele Roberts
0	5	The surprise contender because it is not yet published.
0	5	Roberts comes from an Anglo-French Catholic background and this informs her new novel with a strong rural-Normandy atmosphere.
0	5	Two cousins, one pious, one worldly.
0	5	Shades of Saint Therese of Lisieux.
0	5	Lots of action in the kitchen; something is hidden in the cellar.
0	5	Sacred Hunger by Barry Unsworth
0	5	Unsworth's massive novel about the 1750s slave trade came out early this year to widespread critical praise.
0	5	The shipboard detail the horrors of the trade brilliantly done.
0	5	The judges will have to rule on the characterisation of the European protagonists who go off to found a Utopia in Florida.
0	5	The judges this year, who will include Independent journalist Mark Lawson and John Coldstream, literary editor of The Daily Telegraph, will be chaired by the biographer Victoria Glendinning.
0.0974025974025974	5	The winner will be named at a Guildhall dinner on Tuesday October 13.
0.0802139037433155	5	Last year the prize was won by Ben Okri, for his book The Famished Road.
0	6	It is a sensational shortlist: a bestseller about love and hypnotism, a blockbuster about battles and brides in Ruritania, and a pornographic shocker about teenage sex and baby murder so explicit that only an obscure Newcastle publisher would risk printing it.
0	6	Out are the eminences gris of Victorian letters novels by Thomas Hardy and Mrs Humphry Ward, who advised Gladstone and Roosevelt, didn't make the grade.
0.104895104895105	6	This week the shortlist for the hypothetical 1894 Booker Prize will be announced by six judges, including biographer Victoria Glendinning and broadcaster Melvyn Bragg.
0	6	They have avoided dull and worthy classics and chosen six books which stirred the fin de siecle world and remain compelling today: George du Maurier's Trilby, Anthony Hope's The Prisoner of Zenda, George Moore's Esther Waters, Kipling's Jungle Book, George Gissing's In the Year of Jubilee and RL Stevenson's The Ebb Tide.
0.0909090909090909	6	The winner will be revealed on October 15 at the Cheltenham Festival of Literature.
0.181818181818182	6	Like today's Booker Prize, it is a publishing gimmick; Everyman, which is backing the spoof award, is a significant publisher of classic Victorian novels.
0	6	But the retrospective Booker is also a fascinating exercise in historical reconstruction.
0	6	It raises questions about how the relationship between literature and society has changed in the past 100 years.
0	6	First, the similarities.
0	6	A good yarn is a good yarn.
0	6	Of the 1894 books, Trilby is the tale of a tone-deaf model who sings like an angel when mesmerised by the sinister hypnotist Svengali, then croaks like a crow when he dies during one of her concerts.
0	6	The Prisoner of Zenda tells of an Englishman impersonating the King of Ruritania and rescuing him from demons.
0	6	On the 1994 list Romesh Guneskera's Reef is about a Sri Lankan servant boy and his mysterious master, while Jill Paton Walsh's Knowledge of Angels re-enacts the wolf-child legend.
0	6	All the books on both lists are gripping stories.
0	6	The lists share key themes.
0	6	Both, for instance, have books about colonial exploitation Stevenson's The Ebb Tide and Abdulrazak Gurnah's Paradise, which is set in the First World War in German East Africa.
0	6	Both provoke in similar ways.
0	6	The controversial books of 1894 were Trilby, with its louche vie boheme milieu, and Esther Waters, in which a 17-year-old girl is seduced, impregnated and offered the services of a professional baby killer for a fiver.
0.0470219435736677	6	It is now seen as Moore's best work, but in 1894 it had problems finding a publisher and the powerful circulating libraries refused to take it.
0	6	A century on, the relationship between fiction and sexual morality remains vexed.
0.038961038961039	6	Last week, a Times critic complained about the inclusion of Alan Hollinghurst's candid novel of homosexual love, The Folding Star, on the Booker list, because it offended Judaeo-Christian ethics.
0.12396694214876	6	But even if Hollinghurst wins the Booker, his novel will not become the succes de scandale of Esther Waters and Trilby, which became the bestselling novel of the 19th century.
0.12396694214876	6	For the great difference between then and now is that in 1894 a Booker Prize was not needed to sell fiction.
0	6	Today, we accept the gap between literary writing, such as Hollinghurst's, and popular bestsellers by writers like Jeffrey Archer and Barbara Cartland.
0.0568181818181818	6	This is the gap the Booker tries to bridge by giving high-level publicity to works which would not normally reach a mass audience.
0	6	The trick works last year's winner, Roddy Doyle's Paddy Clarke Ha Ha Ha sold 360,000 hardback copies.
0.151515151515152	6	Before the short-list was announced it sold 10,600.
0	6	The Victorians, in contrast, were lovers of contemporary fiction.
0	6	Novels accounted for 20 per cent of published books, and no distinction was made between high and low art.
0	6	In the mid 19th century, Dickens made Pounds 12,000 for Little Dorrit, the equivalent of nearly Pounds 400,000 today.
0	6	Between 1861 and 1894, when the population of the UK was half that of today and the literate population smaller still, Mrs Henry Wood's East Lynne sold 400,000 copies.
0	6	All the 1894 Booker writers were popular names; they were also serious, skilful writers whose books can be reread with pleasure 100 years later.
0	6	Why was fiction so much closer to the public heart in 1894?
0	6	Social, cultural and psychological reasons play a part.
0	6	Socially, the 1890s reading public was a vastly more homogenous group than today: a small number of middle class authors wrote for a middle class audience at a time when to be literate was to belong to an elite.
0	6	The idea of a two-tier, up and down-market, fiction was irrelevant.
0.109090909090909	6	Culturally, these writers and readers were certain of their place in the mainstream, and the novel was their political and intellectual forum.
0.0717703349282297	6	Today we no longer share the Victorian confidence in the novel as a key genre of our age.
0.0505050505050505	6	Modernism and the overturning of the traditional form by Joyce and Woolf weakened 20th-century belief in the novel and encouraged the divergence between highbrow and lowbrow.
0	6	The dominance of film and television has made novels a more marginal form and perhaps they no longer attract the most creative talents.
0.0619834710743802	6	George du Maurier originally offered the outline of Trilby to Henry James, who he thought would write a better novel.
0	6	Today du Maurier would have sold it to Hollywood or the BBC.
0.0737100737100737	6	The fantasy element of fiction, in which we identify with characters as if we know them, was answered in the 19th century by the novel; in the 20th century we have TV soaps.
0.0296442687747036	6	Just as the tabloid newspapers feature characters from EastEnders, so when Dickens' The Old Curiosity Shop was running as a serial there was widespread press speculation on whether Little Nell would die, and readers wrote in begging for her to be saved.
0.0717703349282297	6	Sentimentality, accessibility, topicality what characterises today's soaps were clear features of the novel in 1894.
0	6	Both In the Year of Jubilee and Esther Waters, for example, centre on the burning 1890s debate about marriage, feminism and the Woman', yet both are also tearjerkers which everyone enjoyed.
0.0717703349282297	6	The 1894 books are compelling because they prefigure our own times and yet are set back from them.
0	6	Trilby is a tale of hypnotism and the unconscious a decade away from Freud; The Ebb Tide paved the way for Conrad's Heart of Darkness and the first questioning of colonial oppression.
0	6	It is unlikely that the 1994 Booker choices will speak as eloquently of new trends today.
0.0681818181818182	6	Whereas the 1894 titles had contemporary settings, many of the 1994 books are historical or are driven by nostalgia
0.511363636363636	6	Which book will win on October 15?
0	6	Stevenson will get the sympathy vote because he died in 1894 in Samoa, the setting of The Ebb Tide.
0.0247933884297521	6	Jungle Book will get the retrospective vote, because it is the best-known today and has fashionable mythic overtones in the lost paradise of Mowgli's jungle; its position on the list may also rescue it from schmaltzy Disney associations and confirm it as a serious novel about a young man's self-discovery.
0	6	My vote goes to Trilby.
0	6	Soft-focus, ideologically shaky in its anti-Semitic portrait of Svengali and sometimes sloppy, it is a story of demonic possession and haunts the imagination like a fairy tale long after better-written works have faded from memory.
0.0378787878787879	6	Like Rebecca, the popular novel by du Maurier's granddaughter, it is a natural equivalent of what the current Booker Prize seeks to create: a combination of the classic and the bestseller.
0.204545454545455	7	The shortlist of six for the Pounds 20,000 Booker Prize for fiction, announced yesterday, immediately prompted the question
0	7	from many in the publishing industry.
0	7	According to one insider, some on the list B-team writers at best'.
0	7	The six include Alan Hollinghurst's The Folding Star a melancholy study of homosexual obsession which was tipped as a likely candidate from the initial list' of 15, The Reef by young Sri Lankan writer Romesh Gunesekera and How Late It Was, How Late by gritty Glasgow realist James Kelman, which was almost universally well-reviewed.
0	7	As for the other three Knowledge of Angels a philosophical fable by children's author Jill Paton Walsh, Paradise by Zanzibar-born writer Abdulrazak Gurnah and Beside the Ocean of Time by 72-year-old Orcadian poet George Mackay Brown they don't make the grade'.
0.0606060606060606	7	The shortlist for the Booker, the UK's most hyped literary prize and one of the most lucrative, is all the more surprising in a bumper year for new fiction fulfilling the criteria English language and non-American for consideration for the award.
0	7	Margaret Atwood's The Robber Bride seems an astonishing omission, as do new novels by Peter Ackroyd, Peter Carey, Candia McWilliam, William Trevor and Jim Crace.
0.0974025974025974	7	But if the shortlist of the final six candidates for the prize may be disappointing, the traditional controversy surrounding the award is as rife as ever.
0	7	One unsurprising omission from the final selection was When The World Was Steady, a first novel by Claire Messud, which was on the list' before it was pointed out that the author was the wife of James Wood, chief literary reviewer of The Guardian newspaper and a Booker judge.
0.0779220779220779	7	Professor John Bayley, chairman of the Booker panel and husband of former Booker Prize winner Dame Iris Murdoch, expressed surprise at Mr Wood's failure to reveal his relationship with Ms Messud.
0	7	But it is the final list, rather than the controversy, that discredits the award according to some critics.
0.136363636363636	7	list,' said one man of letters, have dealt a final death blow to the Booker.'
0.170454545454545	7	The winner, selected from an original 130, will be announced on October 11.
0.0974025974025974	8	After hours of heated delib-eration under a system described as by one judge the Pounds 20,000 Booker Prize for fiction last night went to Mr James Kelman for How Late It Was, How Late, published by Secker and Warburg.
0.0619834710743802	8	The novel, a story of Scottish low-life narrated largely in Glaswegian dialect, is unlikely to prove a popular choice with booksellers, who have damned all six books shortlisted for the prize as boring, elitist and worst of all unsaleable.
0.0592885375494071	8	Professor John Bayley, chairman of the Booker judges, acknowledged that Mr Kelman's book in particular might be deemed inaccessible.
0	8	had an extremely difficult final meeting and were very divided,' he said after three hours of debate.
0	8	Rabbi Julia Neuberger, the only woman on the judging panel, said she was made extremely cross by the decision.
0	8	just a drunken Scotsman railing against bureaucracy,' she said.
0	8	eyes are stretched in disbelief.
0	8	The voting system is completely mad.
0	8	Kelman was the least favourite of the three front runners.
0	8	If it had been a short story it would have been fine.'
0.25974025974026	8	Mr Kelman's book is, according to some observers, the most difficult work to have won the prize.
0	8	In his acceptance speech, Mr Kelman, perceived by some as a Scottish isolationist, anticipated the criticism, by declaring: culture and my language have the right to exist.'
0.0634249471458774	8	One guest at the prize-giving dinner at London's Guildhall, Mr Salman Rushdie, who won the prize in 1981 with Midnight's Children, remarked: Kelman is good, but not as good as he thinks he is.'
0.0974025974025974	8	The Booker prize has, in its 26-year history, always provoked controversy.
0	8	But this year's rows have been of a particularly fine vintage.
0	8	Prof Bayley went on record with a rousing condemnation of contemporary fiction.
0.0340909090909091	8	Another judge, Mr James Wood, literary critic of The Guardian, was attacked for failing to reveal that a young novelist being considered for the award, Ms Claire Messud, was in fact Mrs James Wood.
0	8	Most damaging of all was the verdict of the booksellers, who dismissed the shortlist as narcoleptic.
0	8	The other contenders were The Folding Star by Alan Hollinghurst, Beside the Ocean of Time by George Mackay Brown, Paradise by Abdulrazak Gurnah, Reef by Romesh Gunesekera and Knowledge of Angels by Jill Paton Walsh.
0.0619834710743802	8	In spite of heavy publicity, the novels nominated have been selling 50 per cent less than last year's shortlist.
0	8	Last year's winner, Roddy Doyle's Paddy Clarke Ha Ha Ha, sold 350,000 copies.
0.0974025974025974	8	novel is unlikely to come anywhere near that,' one bookseller said.
0.0852272727272727	8	Mr Kelman was also shortlisted for the prize in 1989 for his novel A Disaffection.
0	9	On the day of the Big Event, Ladbroke, the large British betting agency, posted the final odds.
0	9	Brian Moore was the favorite at 7-4, followed by Peter Ackroyd Iris Murdoch and Chinua Achebe
0	9	The two dark horses, Nina Bawden and Penelope Lively, were each tipped at 7-1.
0	9	You may have noticed a distinctly literary tilt to that lineup, an affinity with the bookshelf, not the bookie.
0.227272727272727	9	All of those people published new works of fiction here in Britain during the past 12 months.
0.181818181818182	9	And for the last few weeks, literary punters throughout the British Isles have been placing bets on which of those writers would win the Booker Prize, the best-known, best-liked and, almost incidentally, most prestigious fiction award in the land.
0.0681818181818182	9	In recent weeks the Booker contenders have received almost as much press coverage as the Charles and Di rift.
0	9	And nearly every article, from book reviews to author interviews, has featured the latest odds.
0.141065830721003	9	The betting is done largely by literary insiders, says Graham Sharpe, who sets the Booker odds at William Hill, Britain's other big betting agency.
0	9	read the books, hear the gossip and want to pull off a little coup for themselves," he says.
0	9	Last year's winner, Old Devils" by Kingsley Amis, was a 5-2 favorite, but this year, anyone who chose the victor made some dough.
0	9	she accepted her prize for Tiger," Penelope Lively looked surprised and pleased.
0	9	not a betting woman, and I have slight reservations about books becoming a spectator sport," she said in soft Oxbridge tones.
0	9	those who are in the know tell me that 7-1 was an irresistible flutter."
0	9	Her 65-year-old mother was among those who made a killing.
0.280748663101604	9	America has the Pulitzer Prize for fiction and the National Book Awards, but in terms of excitement, hoopla and man-on-the-street interest, there's nothing akin to the 15,000-pound Booker Prize.
0	9	With the possible exception of France's respected Prix Goncourt, there's nothing quite like it anywhere else.
0.113636363636364	9	Britons wryly compare the Booker to the Academy Awards, and though there's just one prize and no envelope, similarities exist.
0	9	There's a team of judges and a pool of candidates.
0.378787878787879	9	This year each British publisher could submit three new titles, for a grand total of 93.
0.0290135396518375	9	As one judge noted wearily, August, I was in more than a slight panic, sometimes reading all day and evening; reading while standing at the bus stop, reading while cooking, reading, almost, while talking on the telephone."
0.0717703349282297	9	Next comes the the judges' top six, which was announced with great fanfare in late September.
0	9	This year the works included Brian Moore's political thriller Color of Blood" Peter Ackroyd's Nina Bawden's of Deceit" Iris Murdoch's 23rd novel Book and the Brotherhood" Nigerian writer Chinua Achebe's of the Savannah" and Tiger"
0	9	The awards presentation came on the last Thursday in October, and like any major awards presentation, it came complete with limousines, banquet and television cameras.
0.0802139037433155	9	The suspense was genuine; the judges chose the winner just three hours before the announcement.
0.0649350649350649	9	To be sure, the ratings for the prime-time broadcast didn't upstage those of Britain's popular soap opera.
0.0413223140495868	9	Yet interest was sufficient for Andre Deutsch, Tiger's" British publisher, to order up an additional 20,000 copies almost the minute Mrs. Lively and the nation heard the news.
0.0568181818181818	9	By British standards, sales figures for recent Booker winners are stunning, from Old Devils" to Anita Brookner's du Lac"
0	9	Even Keri Hulme's Bone People," a look at Maori culture that most readers found impenetrable, reached a respectable 21,000 in 1985.
0	9	Short-listed authors are just a few paces behind, sharing the best-seller list with Dick Francis and Scott Turow.
0	9	Heinemann initially printed 3,000 copies of of the Savannah," the usual run for contemporary literary fiction.
0	9	So far, 10,000 copies have sold.
0	9	short-listed probably changed the destiny of that book," declares a member of the Heinemann sales staff.
0	9	Indeed, there's currently talk of initiating a similar prize with a similar purse for the year's best biography.
0.0505050505050505	9	Another notable spinoff is the Booker harpies, readers intent on digesting all six titles, then vigorously disputing the choices, which never please everyone.
0	9	This year the Sunday Times offered readers a complete autographed collection of the six books for the equivalent of $112, perfect fodder for the literary cocktail party cot.
0	9	It wasn't always this way, of course.
0.25974025974026	9	Headlines were modest back in 1969 when P.H. Newby won the first ever Booker Prize for to Answer For."
0.131964809384164	9	The idea was to devise a British equivalent to the Prix Goncourt, and like that august French award, the Booker attracted attention the minute it kicked up controversy.
0.0592885375494071	9	The early fuss was kept within the literary world, with critics sniping over choices and the prize's varied ground rules.
0	9	The real world took notice in 1974, when Elizabeth Jane Howard, one of the three judges, wrote a letter to the Times claiming that in her opinion Kingsley Amis's Up," one of the short-listed books, was his best ever.
0	9	As it happens, she was married to Mr. Amis at the time.
0	9	He didn't win.
0.0243506493506494	9	But many credit the Booker's current appeal to the 1982 competition and Thomas Keneally's Ark," or List" as it is known in the U.S. Written as a novel, the book told the true story of a remarkable German who saved the lives of hundreds of Jews in concentration camps.
0.320855614973262	9	But even after it won the Booker, people argued that it wasn't a novel.
0	9	more people questioned it, the more it sold," says Ion Trewin, editorial director at Hodder Stoughton.
0.104895104895105	9	was the first year the prize caught the media and public imagination.
0.136363636363636	9	Suddenly the Booker gained inches on front pages."

0	0	Tower, 63, a U.S. senator from Texas for 24 years, was admitted to Baylor University Medical Center on Wednesday after undergoing a colonscopy examination last week that revealed the polyp, Habgood said.
0.0909090909090909	0	A preliminary biopsy of the polyp showed it was benign, Habgood said, but further results would be announced Friday by Tower's surgeon, Dr. R.D. Dignan, of Dallas.
0	0	Thursday's surgery took approximately three hours, Habgood said.
0	0	When Tower underwent the colonscopy examination, a rectal polyp also was discovered and removed.
0	0	Tests of that growth showed it to contain some malignant but well differentiated cells, Habgood said.
0.107142857142857	0	Further explanation of the first polyp removal would have to come from Tower's surgeon, who was unavailable for comment Thursday night, the spokesman said.
0.1875	0	After leaving the Senate in 1985, Tower went into business as a defense consultant.
0	0	He also served as an arms negotiator for President Reagan and he headed the White House's Iran-Contra investigative panel.
0	0	President-elect Bush designated Tower as his defense secretary on Dec. 16.
0.75	0	The nomination is subject to Senate approval.
0.193548387096774	1	Defense Secretary-designate John Tower contradicted an earlier sworn statement when he told the Senate his work for a British firm involved no military matters, according to reports published Saturday.
0	1	Meanwhile, new questions were raised about the thoroughness of the FBI's background investigation of the embattled nominee.
0	1	One newspaper reported that several bizarre accidents, including early-morning car crashes and a hotel fire, apparently were overlooked in the probe.
0.66	1	The Senate Armed Services Committee has put the nomination of Tower, a former Texas senator and onetime chairman of the committee, on hold while it takes a second look at Tower's personal habits, including his use of alcohol, and his links to defense contractors.
0.264705882352941	1	Tower, who has declined to be interviewed while his nomination is pending, has denied in his Senate testimony any problem with alcohol or any conflicts of interest concerning his business ties.
0.12	1	A White House spokesman, Stephen Hart, declined on Saturday to comment on the latest reports, saying it's before the committee.
0.15	1	Tower's designated spokesman, attorney Paul Eggers of Dallas, did not answer a reporter's calls Saturday.
0.153846153846154	1	In written testimony to the Senate panel on Jan. 26, Tower said he could recall no actions in connection with any defense activities in connection with his work for the U.S. subsidiary of British Aerospace, Inc.
0	1	That statement, according to two publications, The Los Angeles Times and the Legal Times, did not square with information which Tower provided to divorce attorneys working for his second wife in June of 1987.
0.0576923076923077	1	In the divorce deposition, Tower said he went to work for British Aerospace eight weeks after resigning as the nation's chief strategic arms negotiator and advised the company on how to sell training jets, fighter planes and missile systems to the Pentagon, the Los Angeles Times reported.
0.111111111111111	1	Tower told the Senate committee he worked chiefly on selling commercial aircraft to U.S. airlines and also advised the firm on trade legislation and currency fluctuations.
0	1	He said he earned $265,000 from the company between June of 1986 and last December.
0	1	The Legal Times said Tower told the divorce attorneys that he was retained by British Aerospace for his advice on how to sell weapons systems to the Pentagon, and that he listed the various weapons involved.
0	1	The deposition was never filed in court because Tower did not contest the divorce, but a copy was obtained by the FBI, the Legal Times said.
0	1	It said its reporters were allowed by attorneys to read it with the understanding that it not be quoted directly.
0.1875	1	The New York Post reported Saturday that the FBI apparently has not bothered to talk to Tower's neighbors, examine certain police records or investigate several car accidents involving Tower.
0	1	The Post, citing syndicated columnist Cody Shearer, said the incidents included an early-morning episode on June 6, 1967, when Tower was trapped in his hotel suite in Dallas by a blaze he accidentally set by dropping a cigarette on an overstuffed armchair.
0	1	When firemen broke into his room to remove him, he was reportedly in no condition to free himself, the Post said.
0	1	The newspaper also said Tower wrecked his car in two early-morning accidents within weeks of one another in 1970, and, two years earlier, he drove into a bicycle ridden by James Patrick Montoya, son of the late Sen. Joseph Montoya, D-N.M., on his way home from work.
0	1	The youth was not seriously hurt.
0	1	FBI spokesman Bill Carter refused comment on specifics of the Tower investigation, but said We will follow any lead.
0.183673469387755	1	On Friday, Tower authorized the release of a statement that recent hospital tests showed no evidence of alcohol abuse, and Vice President Dan Quayle said, I have never seen drinking being a factor in John Tower's life other than a social glass of wine.
0	1	Eggers, meanwhile, acknowledged that there was no question that Tower sometimes drank too much in the early 1970s, but he said: He is not an alcoholic.
0	1	He's not had a drinking problem for years.
0.25531914893617	2	Rep. Larry Combest, R-Texas, issued a terse statement Tuesday supporting Defense-Secretary designate John Tower but refused to comment on a published report that he told Senate Armed Services Committee leaders that Tower used to drink up to a bottle of scotch at a sitting.
0.25	2	An unidentified congressional source told The Washington Post that Combest's statement about Tower's drinking habits in the 1970s came down on Sen. Sam Nunn, the committee chairman, like a ton of bricks and was a factor in Nunn's opposition to the nomination.
0.0909090909090909	2	The newspaper reported that Combest later gave a different story to the FBI, saying that Tower and a group of friends not Tower alone had frequently consumed a bottle of scotch.
0	2	After meeting with staff and advisers, Combest, who worked for then-Sen.
0	2	Tower in the 1970s, issued a two-sentence statement supporting his fellow Texan.
0	2	As a member of Congress, I have tremendous respect and full confidence in the senator and his abilities to lead this country's armed forces.
0.5	2	In my judgment, John Tower will be a superb secretary of defense, the statement said.
0	2	Combest spokesman Rich Adams refused to comment further, and said Combest was not available to speak to reporters.
0.272727272727273	2	The Washington Post reported that Combest described for Nunn and Sen. John W. Warner of Virginia, the ranking Republican on the committee, Tower's heavy drinking bouts in the 1970s.
0	2	A congressional source was quoted as saying that Combest told the senators that Tower would drink as much as a full bottle of scotch two or three times a week.
0.1875	2	Trudi Boyd, Combest's administrative assistant, told the Post that Combest originally went to Nunn and Warner to tell them Tower had ended his previous excessive abuse of alcohol.
0	2	Boyd also told the Post that a group of people drank the entire bottle of scotch, not Tower alone.
0	2	That was the account Combest gave the FBI following his talk with Nunn and Warner, the newspaper said.
0	2	It said that in that account, Combest said that he had only seen Tower drunk on two or three occasions.
0.130434782608696	2	Tower has acknowledged that he drank excessively in the 1970s, but says he has reduced his intake to wine with dinner.
0.166666666666667	2	On Sunday, he promised to not drink a drop of alcohol if confirmed as defense secretary.
0	2	Combest, 43, worked for Tower for seven years, 1971-1978, as a legislative assistant handling agricultural legislation and policy.
0.176470588235294	2	Tower served in the Senate for 24 years, deciding not to seek re-election in 1984.
0.857142857142857	2	He was chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee from 1981 through 1984.
0.72	2	The committee, now controlled by Democrats, voted 11-9 along party lines last Thursday to recommend the full Senate reject Tower's nomination.
0.290322580645161	3	The Democratic-controlled Senate today rejected the nomination of former Texas Sen. John Tower as defense secretary, delivering a major rebuke to President Bush just 49 days into his term.
0.6	3	The Senate's 53-47 vote came after a bitter and divisive debate focused on Tower's drinking habits, behavior toward women and his business dealings with defense contractors.
0.342857142857143	3	It was only the ninth time in 200 years that the Senate has voted to reject a president's Cabinet choice and the only time it has done so early in a new administration.
0.285714285714286	3	Vice President Dan Quayle presided over the Senate during the roll call, underscoring Bush's commitment to the nominee.
0.157894736842105	3	The Senate galleries were packed and virtually all senators were in their seats as the roll was called.
0.45	3	The nomination of John Tower to be secretary of defense is not confirmed, Quayle intoned after the vote.
0	3	Kansas GOP Sen. Nancy Kassebaum provided the biggest surprise of the final hours of debate when she became the sole Republican to declare her opposition.
0.130434782608696	3	She said her most serious concerns were over Tower's activities as a defense consultant after serving as an arms control negotiator.
0	3	She also expressed doubts that he would pay enough attention to ensuring fairness for women in the military.
0.103448275862069	3	Tower's Republican defenders began to speak of him in the past tense and the nominee also appeared to accept defeat, even before the roll was called.
0.620689655172414	3	Just moments ago I took a call from John Tower, said Sen. John Warner of Virginia, the senior GOP member of the Senate Armed Services Committee.
0	3	His head is high, his voice is strong, Warner said.
0	3	He asked me to convey thanks in his words to the troops who rallied to his support.
0.230769230769231	3	Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, moved to repair damage caused by the bitter struggle to relations between the Senate and President Bush.
0	3	I know what's in my heart and in my mind, he told reporters.
0	3	I want to directly, clearly and unambiguously say that this doesn't represent an effort to be harmful to the president.
0.0833333333333333	3	Dole agreed to a late-afternoon vote on the nomination after acknowledging the collapse of a last-minute bid to give Tower an extraordinary six-month trial period as defense secretary to prove he could abstain from drinking.
0.222222222222222	3	There was no doubt about the outcome as the Senate went through the motions of debating the nomination through the final hours before the roll call.
0	3	The last few undecided senators declared their positions.
0.214285714285714	3	Sen. John B. Breaux, D-La., said he would vote against Tower.
0.214285714285714	3	Sen. James M. Jeffords, R-Vt., said he would support the nomination.
0.413793103448276	3	Senators from both parties credited Tower's defeat to the decision to oppose him made by Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., chairman of the Armed Services Committee.
0	3	When he made his decision all the other Democrats wheeled in behind him, said Sen. John Chafee, R-R.I. With the prospect of defeat seemingly inevitable, White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said, If necessary, we'll come up with a candidate very rapidly.
0	3	Names most frequently mentioned in White House speculation as a replacement for Tower if his nomination failed are Sen. Warner, a former secretary of the Navy
0	3	former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld
0	3	former Rep. Jack Edwards, R-Ala.
0	3	and national security adviser Brent Scowcroft.
0	3	Scowcroft replied No when asked this morning if he was in line for the Pentagon job.
0	3	It must be clear to all that people like the chief of staff and the national security adviser, any number of congressmen and senators and any number of other outside experts have candidates on the tip of their tongue, Fitzwater said.
0	3	But the time has not come, he added.
0	3	The time will come as soon as the vote is completed.
0	3	We will wait until then.
0.125	3	The most recent Associated Press survey showed 52 Democrats and one Republican committed to vote against Tower or leaning strongly in that direction.
0.2	3	It showed 41 Republicans and three Democrats declared for Tower or leaning his way.
0.15	3	Nevertheless, the White House said it wanted to see the nomination go all the way to a vote.
0	3	Tower, meanwhile, reported for work at the Pentagon where he and his three daughters had coffee together.
0	3	He then continued a review of various administration proposals.
0	3	I hope and believe we can work together on important matters, Mitchell said.
0	3	The tension of this issue will have no long-lasting effect on the relationship.
0	3	I want to say from the bottom of my heart that I hope this will be the case.
0	3	The already slim chance Tower would be confirmed was dealt a crushing blow on Wednesday as a parade of previously undecided Democratic senators announced they would vote no.
0.130434782608696	3	Only Democrat Lloyd Bentsen of Texas said he would vote yes, joining just two other Democrats who have made that decision.
0.0833333333333333	3	Sens. Charles Robb, D-Va., Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn., J. Bennett Johnston, D-La., Dale Bumpers, D-Ark., and Claiborne Pell, D-R.I., all said they would vote against Tower.
0.0714285714285714	3	Johnston said his reading of the FBI report on Tower leaves him with the clear impression that Tower's personality changes when he drinks heavily, leading to a recklessness in the social sense entirely different from his behavior when sober.
0.25	4	John G. Tower has fallen, but the sky has not.
0.25	4	For all the forecasts of dire results if the Senate blocked Tower's path to the Pentagon, business is proceeding as usual.
0.2	4	President Bush said the case was closed and accepted Democratic assurances of future cooperation.
0.222222222222222	4	That doesn't undo the resentment among some of Tower's more ardent Republican allies in the Senate and in some corners of the White House.
0	4	Bush lieutenants claimed they had heard what sounded like assurances of support from a dozen Senate Democrats.
0.428571428571429	4	They ended up with only three Democrats in the close-to-party-line vote against Tower.
0	4	Nevertheless, a week after the former Texas senator was denied confirmation as secretary of defens, the waters have closed.
0	4	There will be ripples, and some of them could be wave-sized.
0.09375	4	The good-behavior rules set in the debate over Tower's drinking habits and his lucrative defense consulting business are certain to be invoked as precedents whenever Republicans spot a Democratic target.
0	4	We've established what will be known as the Tower standards, said Sen. John Warner, R-Va.
0	4	That argument will be used by House Republicans challenging the financial conduct of House Speaker Jim Wright.
0	4	But it will be a debating point, not a turning point, in a Wright controversy that was ordained long before the Tower episode.
0.157894736842105	4	While President Bush was unwavering in his support of Tower, he burned no bridges to congressional Democrats.
0.290322580645161	4	He insisted that Tower was the best man for the job and he spoke out repeatedly for his choice, even after it was clear that the nomination was doomed.
0	4	But he didn't get nasty about it, saying there was no point in escalating the fight.
0	4	That's over, he said 24 hours after the Tower defeat.
0	4	And now we are going to go forward.
0	4	The 53-47 vote against Tower was a setback to Bush in the sense that it always is a defeat when Congress denies a president something he wants.
0	4	But this denial did not cost Bush a program, or a major campaign pledge, or the support of voters.
0.115384615384615	4	Indeed, it could turn out that the Senate did the president a favor by sending Tower back to Texas instead of to the Pentagon.
0	4	It was a break Bush could not make with a political ally who had been after the Pentagon job since Ronald Reagan was elected president.
0.1875	4	Tower had not been a Reagan man he had supported Bush for the 1980 nomination.
0	4	And the Reagan White House went to some lengths to rule the senator out of the job he sought, declaring that the new president would not be nominating any Senate Republican for any Cabinet post.
0.176470588235294	4	After Tower's long wait, Bush displayed his own loyalty, all the way to a losing vote when the standard, somewhat safer course would have been to withdraw the nominee.
0.115384615384615	4	Tower not only shunned withdrawal; he offered conditions that had to be humiliating, if only the Senate would let him have the job.
0.230769230769231	4	Tower promised to quit drinking, taking the pledge on national television.
0	4	And when that didn't work, he offered to become the first-ever probationary Cabinet member.
0	4	Republicans proposed that he get the job for a six-month trial and then return for reconfirmation, a gimmick that would have changed the system and could have haunted the presidency.
0.45	4	So Tower became the ninth Cabinet nominee ever to be rejected, the first who was a former senator.
0	4	Bush said he had been fighting for the right of a president to appoint his own Cabinet, but he avoided language that would have raised the political stakes.
0	4	Tower did not restrain himself.
0	4	Battling for the job, he said withdrawal would damage Bush and rejection would be damning the president's judgment.
0	4	He said his nomination had been turned into a vehicle for a major presidential defeat.
0.214285714285714	4	Tower's advocates on the Senate floor said grave constitutional issues were at stake, that the authority of the presidency was on the line, that the Senate will come to rue the rules it wrote in the Tower decision.
0	4	But Bush said all along that the outcome, either way, would not hurt on other issues.
0.285714285714286	4	Sen. Sam Nunn, chairman of the Armed Services Committee and the pivotal figure in the Tower defeat, agreed.
0.1875	4	He told his Georgia constituents that the Tower rejection would not hurt Bush's leadership.
0	4	In Washington, and are short-lived, Nunn said, and that's particularly true of the president.
0	4	Walter R. Mears, vice president and columnist for The Associated Press, has reported on Washington and national politics for more than 25 years.
0.153846153846154	5	In the first eruption of controversy at a confirmation hearing for a Bush Administration Cabinet nominee, a prominent conservative told a Senate panel Tuesday that John Tower may lack the character" to be secretary of defense.
0.357142857142857	5	the course of many years, I have encountered the nominee in a condition lack of sobriety as well as with women to whom he was not married," conservative activist Paul M. Weyrich told the Senate Armed Services Committee.
0	5	encountered it frequently enough to the point where it made an impression," he added.
0	5	Criticism from Weyrich and other witnesses prompted some committee members to temper the panel's earlier praise for the former Texas senator.
0	5	But several members conceded that, while their former colleague may not be the ideal candidate for the Pentagon's top job, he probably will win Senate approval anyway.
0	5	had a surplus of rumors concerning the nominee, and a shortage of witnesses with personal testimony and personal knowledge," said committee Chairman Sam Nunn
0.0967741935483871	5	Weyrich, president of the conservative Free Congress Foundation, testified that Tower's behavior makes him unfit to lead the Pentagon into an era of belt-tightening and management reform.
0.157894736842105	5	In an extraordinary challenge to Tower's nomination, Weyrich also suggested that Tower's moral shortcomings could make him vulnerable to attempts by foreign governments bring pressure on the United States government and on him personally.
0	5	is unrealistic to expect moral behavior in matters of public trust from someone who does not exhibit such behavior in his personal life," Weyrich said.
0	5	morals have public effects."
0.3	5	Tower, 63 and twice-divorced, served 24 years in the Senate from Texas, including a tenure as chairman of the Armed Services Committee from 1981 to 1984.
0	5	He has been dogged by reports that he is a hard-drinker and a womanizer and that his hawkish views on defense do not square with the budgetary austerity that the Pentagon faces.
0.214285714285714	5	In announcing Tower as his choice for the post on Dec. 16, President Bush called the talk lot of rumors that proved to be groundless."
0.130434782608696	5	Saying that went to China," Bush added that Tower's record of support for Pentagon spending hikes could be overturned.
0.0909090909090909	5	But Weyrich's attack raised anew the issue of Tower's fitness for the job, after two days of testimony last week in which Tower won broad praise from committee members.
0	5	Ties to Contractors
0.0967741935483871	5	Fulbright Institute scholar William C. Jackson Jr. and William G. Phillips, president of the Washington-based National Council for Industrial Defense, joined Weyrich Tuesday in opposing Tower's nomination.
0.3	5	Phillips echoed Jackson's complaint that Tower's lucrative ties to defense contractors and past support for big defense budgets raise doubts that John Tower is the best man for the job at this time in our history."
0	5	A leading committee Democrat acknowledged this point.
0.0789473684210526	5	wondered why the President of the United States chose John Tower for this job, given the emphasis that he has placed on ethics and the appearance of wrongdoing," said Nebraska Sen. James J. Exon.
0	5	the facts of the matter are that he has."
0	5	Sen. John W. Warner
0.0769230769230769	5	in clarifying the grounds on which Senate committees may assess presidential nominees, told witnesses that is not a function of the Senate to say that this individual, this nominee, is the best man qualified."
0.416666666666667	5	Weyrich also told the committee that President Bush's transition team hundreds of letters" opposing Tower's nomination, some of which specific allegations of moral impropriety on the part of Mr. Tower."
0.111111111111111	5	In a closed session of the committee, Weyrich was unable to add to his own observations with more than hearsay, according to Sen. Malcolm Wallop
0	5	Weyrich also acknowledged that he had no personal knowledge of the existence or content of the letters.
0.117647058823529	5	But the allegation, reviewed in advance by the committee, prompted Nunn and Warner, the panel's ranking minority member, to write White House counsel C. Boyden Gray asking whether the allegations were investigated by the FBI and addressed in the bureau's report to the committee.
0	5	Wallop, a Tower supporter and a leading Senate conservative, termed it that have been made, the insinuations are on the table, but the cameras do not record the fact that they are unsustainable."
0	5	In open testimony, Weyrich also reflected widespread concerns among conservative activists that Tower is not committed to the Pentagon's Wars" missile defense program.
0	5	considers SDI a bargaining chip," Weyrich said.
0.2	5	The panel hopes to complete its deliberations by the end of this week, Nunn said, and expects to meet once more today to consider Tower's nomination.
0.195652173913043	6	In its renewed investigation of defense secretary nominee John Tower, the FBI is checking allegations that Tower was recently involved in an episode of public drunkenness, sources said Friday allegations that call into question his insistence that he has no current drinking problem.
0.529411764705882	6	Tower testified in confirmation hearings earlier this week that his problems with alcohol are behind him.
0.127659574468085	6	But a senior member of the Armed Services Committee, who asked not to be identified, said Friday that the new allegation, if true, suggests that the former Texas senator's drinking problem be ongoing" and that his confirmation remains in doubt.
0.0833333333333333	6	The charge received Wednesday by the committee was very specific, giving the date and place of the alleged incident, and was made by an informant who identified herself, a knowledgeable source said.
0	6	The episode allegedly occurred within the last year at the Monocle, a Capitol Hill restaurant frequented by lawmakers, lobbyists and congressional aides.
0.0666666666666667	6	Two other allegations under scrutiny by the FBI's special inquiries unit, which is working around the clock this weekend on the Tower matter, involve assertions of another incident of public intoxication and of a recent affair with an unidentified Dallas woman.
0.260869565217391	6	If the new charges should be verified by the FBI, Tower's nomination is doomed, an authoritative committee source said.
0	6	FBI agents spent two hours at the Monocle Friday, interviewing the owner, the maitre d', bartenders and waiters, The Times learned.
0.157894736842105	6	The agents were told that Tower, when he was in the Senate, to drink martinis."
0	6	Wine or Tonic Water
0.0882352941176471	6	But one source said that no one on the staff contradicted Tower's statement that in recent years he has moderated his once-heavy drinking and now drinks only an occasional glass of wine.
0	6	In fact, in recent weeks, the staff told agents, he often has ordered tonic water.
0	6	None of the staff could recall any recent incident of improper behavior by Tower at the restaurant, sources said.
0.3	6	On Thursday, the Armed Services Committee had been set to approve the Tower nomination, but Chairman Sam Nunn
0	6	abruptly canceled the vote because of the new charges, which he referred immediately to FBI Director William S. Sessions.
0.111111111111111	6	The bureau already had conducted an extensive background investigation of Tower, a 24-year Senate veteran who headed the Armed Services panel from 1981 to 1985.
0.176470588235294	6	When he nominated Tower, President Bush said he was satisfied" with the FBI check.
0	6	No Results Until Tuesday
0	6	Nunn said he did not expect the latest FBI inquiry to be completed until at least Tuesday.
0	6	Tower Friday refused to comment, as he has throughout the confirmation inquiry.
0	6	Some Tower supporters complain that committee Democrats are turning the confirmation process into a for partisan political reasons.
0	6	is terribly cruel to a man who's just sort of hanging out there," said committee member Malcolm Wallop
0	6	a Tower supporter.
0	6	White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said that feeling is simply that we believe he will be confirmed but that, whenever there are any new concerns raised, they need to be looked into."
0.214285714285714	6	A senior White House staff member, who asked not to be identified, said Administration officials were getting impatient with the delays in Tower's confirmation.
0	6	kind of wants to get our Cabinet in," the aide said.
0	6	want to see him confirmed and on the job."
0.857142857142857	6	House Armed Services Committee Chairman Les Aspin
0.1875	6	said that the controversy has already hobbled Tower's ability to lead the Pentagon effectively.
0	6	whole nomination process is going to present a problem for him at the Pentagon in terms of running the place," Aspin said.
0	6	Tower Urged to Withdraw
0	6	And two influential defense industry trade magazines on Monday will call for Tower to withdraw from consideration for the Pentagon post.
0.125	6	In an editorial prepared for Monday's issue, Defense News, a trade paper widely read by defense contractors and on Capitol Hill, says: is necessary because the record of Mr. Tower's professional life raises substantive doubt that he can perform with utmost effectiveness
0.0833333333333333	6	Army Times, another prominent defense community publication, says Tower is unsuited for the Defense Department post because of his work as a consultant to defense contractors shortly after leaving government service in 1986.
0	6	It said that speed and greed with which Tower spun through the revolving door is appalling."
0.111111111111111	6	Tower has said that he was paid a total of more than $750,000 by six defense firms in the two years after leaving government service.

0	6	Called Morally Unfit
0.146341463414634	6	Tower's personal conduct, however, became an issue in the hearings on Tuesday, when conservative critic Paul Weyrich charged that the former senator was morally unfit for the post because of a history of drinking and womanizing.
0.2	6	After a lengthy closed session in which Tower was allowed to respond to Weyrich's charges, Nunn asked the nominee publicly whether he had a problem with alcohol.

0.394736842105263	7	The Senate panel weighing John Tower's nomination to be defense secretary has found a substantial discrepancy in Tower's descriptions of his business dealings with a British aircraft and weapons manufacturer, congressional sources said Friday.
0	7	Tower testified last week that he had represented British Aerospace Inc. only on civil aviation matters, not as a consultant on military systems.
0	7	But, in a divorce deposition, taken in June, 1987, Tower stated that he had given the company advice on certain systems to the Defense Department."
0.125	7	In the deposition, Tower said he represented the firm on a range of military programs and was paid $8,000 a month.
0	7	Records show that the payments continued from June, 1986, until December, 1988.
0	7	Also, he served on the board of directors of the company, the U.S. subsidiary of British Aerospace PLC.
0	7	Concerns About Veracity
0.545454545454546	7	The discrepancy, sources said, has prompted concerns about the veracity and completeness of Tower's testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee, the panel hearing testimony on his confirmation.
0	7	And it raises the question of whether Tower should have registered as a lobbyist for foreign interests under the Foreign Agents Registration Act, they said.
0.166666666666667	7	Tower's relationships with arms makers are central to reservations expressed by some senators about his nomination.
0	7	Lawmakers from both parties have said they are concerned that there would be a continuing appearance of conflict of interest hanging over Tower because of his employment by weapons firms, which brought him at least $760,000 in 2 1/2 years not including the more than $200,000 British Aerospace paid him.
0.12	7	In his testimony, Tower has described his lobbying and consulting work for a half-dozen U.S. defense firms that do business with the Pentagon.
0	7	The addition of the British firm to the list would add another and the first foreign-based firm whose interests could pose a potential conflict.
0	7	Sources said the apparent discrepancy in testimony raises the prospect that Tower could be recalled to testify under oath about his work for the firm.
0	7	Tower aides said they had no comment on the matter.
0.375	7	A lengthy FBI investigation into Tower's business dealings and his personal behavior has stalled a vote by the committee on his confirmation.
0.441176470588235	7	The FBI is looking into new charges about Tower's alleged drinking, womanizing and receipt of campaign contributions and has said that it cannot complete the inquiry for another 10 days.
0.0731707317073171	7	The FBI is trying to determine whether Tower, who left the Senate in 1985 after 24 years, received illegal corporate campaign contributions from a military electronics firm that later became part of Unisys Corp., sources said Friday.
0	7	The allegation was raised by a witness in the FBI's massive Ill Wind probe into corruption in Pentagon weapons-buying.
0	7	Federal investigators have not uncovered any evidence that Tower was aware that his 1984 campaign fund received any illicit contributions from consultants employed by former Unisys executive Charles F. Gardner, said to be a central figure in the Pentagon bribery investigation.
0	7	A Unisys spokesman said Friday that the company was conducting an internal inquiry into the matter but had found no evidence of involvement by current corporate employees.
1	7	Armed Services Committee Chairman Sam Nunn
0	7	and other committee members are said to be troubled by these issues and have indicated that they may vote against Tower unless the apparent conflicts and questions are resolved.
0.2	7	The sworn deposition about Tower's business dealings was never filed in court because Tower chose not to contest the divorce from his second wife, Lilla Burt Cummings.
0.214285714285714	7	But the document was obtained by the FBI as part of its background investigation of the nominee and is included in the committee's file on Tower.
0.0810810810810811	7	Tower told the committee in written and oral testimony that he was employed only by the American unit of British Aerospace and that he worked chiefly on selling the company's commercial jets to U.S. airlines.
0	7	He said also that he advised the firm on U.S. trade legislation and gave opinions on currency fluctuations.
0.25	7	Tower told the committee that he could no actions in connection with any defense activities" and did not include his income from British Aerospace among his earnings from consulting work done for defense contractors.
0.0731707317073171	7	In the divorce papers, however, Tower said that he went to work for British Aerospace Inc. on June 1, 1986, eight weeks after resigning as chief negotiator in the U.S.-Soviet strategic arms reductions talks in Geneva.
0	7	Around the same time, he entered into lucrative consulting arrangements with major defense firms, including Rockwell International Inc., Textron Inc., LTV Corp. and Martin Marietta Corp.
0.136363636363636	7	In the deposition, Tower said that Rockwell paid him $120,000 a year but said he was by the firm.
0	7	He said he advised British Aerospace on its chances of selling its training jets, fighter planes and missile systems to the Pentagon.
0	7	Deposition Cites Weapons
0	7	Among the British Aerospace products Tower tried to sell to U.S. military officials were the Tornado fighter, the Hawk trainer, the Rapier anti-aircraft missile and the Seawolf short-range air defense missile for ships, according to the deposition.
0	7	He said in the document that he had been valuable to the firm because he was in in this town" and the defense business pretty well."
0	7	He said that his contacts throughout government made him
0	7	The complex Foreign Agents Registration Act requires individuals working for or representing foreign entities in the United States to register with the Justice Department.
0	7	No registration by Tower is on file, officials said.
0	7	In related developments:
0	7	Vice President Dan Quayle, talking to reporters on a flight to Florida, said that he had known Tower for eight years and have never seen him inebriated.
0.333333333333333	7	I have never seen drinking be a factor in John Tower's life, other than a social glass of wine. Those of us who know him, worked with him, can attest to the fact that he has not had this problem, it did not affect him when he was chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee."
0.115384615384615	7	When asked whether womanizing is a relevant topic for inquiry, he replied: have to look at the qualifications of the secretary of defense.
0.315789473684211	7	Whether he will be a capable secretary of defense and do the job of being secretary of defense.
0	7	Let's focus on the qualifications."
0.125	7	Tower's doctor said Friday that he has no evidence to indicate that the former Texas senator suffered any medical symptoms of alcoholism.
0.0714285714285714	7	Dr. R. D. Dignan, who performed surgery to remove a polyp from Tower's colon on Jan. 5, said that after the operation he advised Tower to limit his drinking to one or two glasses of wine with dinner.
0.0967741935483871	7	A longtime Bush political adviser said that Bush what he was doing" when he named Tower to the post and would not withdraw the nomination, despite the controversy.

0.413793103448276	9	Given Mr. Tower's qualifications for the job intelligence, patriotism and past chairmanship of the Armed Services Committee the nomination should have sailed through with flying colors.
0	9	Instead it sank like the Bismarck.
0.103448275862069	9	Clearly and apparently to his surprise, Mr. Tower had made many enemies since his arrival in Washington in 1961, often rubbing even supporters the wrong way.
0	9	The senator from the Lone Star State could be lordly, in his English-cut suits.
0	9	Once, meeting with the editors of my newspaper which had backed him strongly, he thought nothing of tilting back in his chair, crossing his tiny, well-shod feet atop the conference table.
0	9	When the Tower hearings opened, all manner of accusations came to public notice.
0	9	The New Right activist Paul Weyrich claimed to have seen the senator consorting with A Lady Not His Wife.
0.130434782608696	9	It was reported that Mr. Tower had chased a secretary around his desk and had fondled women at Bergstrom Air Force Base.
0	9	The second wife, whom the senator had recently divorced, possessed a repertory of tales she cheerfully volunteered.
0	9	At his hotel, Mr. Tower was accorded that doubtful tribute to instant-celebrity status, the media stakeout.
0	9	The nominee issued fervent denials: He drank only wine, having long since sworn off scotch; he'd never chased secretaries; his services for defense-industry clients had been proper and modest.
0.15	9	None of the charges, at least on Mr. Tower's showing, proved to have the least substance.

Some of President Bush 's nominees for ambassadorships have been selected as a reward for large money contributions to the Republican Party , according to Democratic senators , and some retired diplomats consider a few not to be qualified . These nominees faced strong questioning from the Democrats during committee hearings but did manage to get a slim approval from the committee . Conservative senators objected to two of Bush 's selections . Most of the president 's picks won easy approval . Two of Bush 's picks received highly favorable reaction : a Latin American expert for ambassador to Nicaragua , and the naming of Thomas Pickering , a well-known diplomat , to India . 
Bush nominated veteran diplomats James Lilley ( formerly CIA ) to China , John Negroponte ( who helped direct CIA aid to Contras ) to Mexico , Deane Hinton to Panama , Harry Shlaudeman to Nicaragua ( over Melissa Wells ) , Thomas Pickering to India , and Wesley Egan to Jordan ( interpreted there as signaling Jordanian importance to the US ) . Edward Perkins became UN ambassador . Nominees Joseph Zappala ( Spain ) , Marvin Semble ( Australia ) , Della Newman ( New Zealand ) , and Joseph Gildenhorn ( Switzerland ) were said qualified only by large campaign contributions , and nomination of loudmouth Peter Secchia ( Italy ) was called a mistake . Other nominations included Shirley Temple Black ( Czechoslovakia ) , Thomas Melady ( Vatican ) , Keith Brown ( Denmark ) , and William Howard Taft IV ( NATO ) . 
0.172727272727273	0	The Senate Foreign Relations Committee today endorsed the nomination of Michigan Republican activist Peter F. Secchia as ambassador to Italy, but the panel's chairman said he feared Secchia might embarrass the United States because of his penchant for making gross remarks.
0.165217391304348	0	The committee's vote was 13-0 in favor of Secchia, a former Republican national committeeman for Michigan and lumber industry executive.
0	0	The chairman, Sen. Claiborne Pell, D-R.I., and Sen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif., voted present, meaning they took no position.
0	0	Pell inserted into the hearing record newspaper accounts containing the distasteful specifics of Mr. Secchia's remarks.
0	0	At his confirmation hearing earlier this month, Secchia pledged to be far more careful as a diplomat in his use of colorful language than he had been in his different role as a political organizer and enthusiast.
0	0	But Pell said he was unpersuaded.
0.292307692307692	0	Tact and careful speech are hallmarks of successful diplomats, Pell said.
0.211111111111111	0	Mr. Secchia has demonstrated that he would bring opposite qualities to the position of ambassador to Italy.
0	0	Italian friends of mine telephoned me from Rome, aghast at the prospect of having Mr. Secchia represent the United States in their country, the chairman said.
0.126666666666667	0	I believe that this nomination is a mistake, and in all likelihood Mr. Secchia will be an embarrasment to the administration and the United States, Pell said.
0.304	0	But he said that since Secchia is the president's choice he would not try to block the nomination or delay action on it.
0.2	1	Joseph B. Gildenhorn, the lawyer and real estate developer named by President Bush as U.S. ambassador to Switzerland, and his immediate family gave nearly $230,000 to Republican campaigns since 1984, disclosure statements show.
0.265116279069767	1	Gildenhorn, according to Senate sources, is one of several Bush ambassadorial nominees who have been rated unqualified by the American Academy of Diplomacy, an organization composed of former high ranking diplomats, including all living former secretaries of state.
0.223529411764706	1	One of a lengthy and growing list of Bush supporters and contributors named to diplomatic posts, Gildenhorn gave $100,000 during the 1988 presidential campaign to the Republican National State Elections Committee.
0	1	The gift was not subject to the disclosure requirements of the Federal Election Campaign Act.
0	1	The 84 contributions made between 1984 and early this year by Gildenhorn and members of his immediate family are being used by Senate Democrats to illustrate their complaint that too many GOP contributors are being given choice diplomatic posts better reserved for Foreign Service professionals.
0	1	Gildenhorn said Friday he could not comment because he is in a confirmation process.
0	1	A report prepared by the State Department for the Foreign Relations Committee said Gildenhorn would make an excellent candidate for an ambassadorship because of his solid background in law and management.
0	1	It also cited another qualification.
0	1	Mr. Gildenhorn has been a strong Republican supporter being a member of the Eagles and Team 100, the State Department said.
0.23030303030303	1	The Republican Eagles are contributors of $10,000 or more in a single year to the Republican National Committee, while Team 100 designates people who have donated $100,000 or more.
0	1	Gildenhorn's political contributions are listed on a disclosure form submitted to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, which has set a hearing on the nomination for this week.
0	1	They totaled $14,675 in 1984, $17,000 in 1985
0	1	$25,469.97 in 1986
0	1	$25,250 in 1987
0	1	$104,350 in 1988
0	1	and $11,000 this year.
0	1	The total: $197,744.97.
0	1	Additionally, his wife, Alma Lee, gave $20,125 over the six years, including $13,000 in 1988
0	1	his daughter, Carolyn, gave $2,000
0	1	his son, Michael, gave $4,050 and his father, Oscar Gildenhorn, gave $5,750.
0	1	That brings the total contributions made by Gildenhorn and his family to the GOP to $229,669.97 since 1984.
0.211111111111111	1	Gildenhorn gave $50,000 during the period to the Republican National Committee or to the Republican Eagles.
0	1	He gave $2,500 in 1985 and $5,000 in 1986 to the Fund for the American Future, a Bush political action committee and contributed the legal limit of $1,000 to the Bush campaign in 1987.
0	1	Gildenhorn also gave thousands of dollars to Republican congressional candidates.
0	1	Included were gifts to the campaigns of Sens. Rudy Boschwitz, R-Minn.
0	1	Bill Cohen, R-Maine
0	1	Pete Domenici, R-N.M.
0	1	Arlen Specter, R-Pa.
0	1	John Warner, R-Va.
0	1	Orrin Hatch, R-Utah
0	1	Bob Kasten, R-Wis.
0	1	and former Sen. Paula Hawkins, R-Fla.
0	1	Gildenhorn, 59, is a senior partner in Brown, Gildenhorn and Jacobs, a law firm specializing in real estate.
0	1	He is also president of the JBG Real Estate Associates and JBG Properties Inc.
0	1	Gildenhorn is also vice chairman of the board of directors of the Sovran Bank here.
0	1	He is a graduate of the University of Maryland and Yale University Law School.
0.304	1	Other ambassadorial nominees rated as unqualified by the American Academy of Diplomacy include Florida real estate developer Joseph Zappala, nominated as ambassador to Spain
0.2375	1	Melvin L. Sembler, a real estate executive in Florida named to be ambassador to Australia
0.361904761904762	1	and Della M. Newman, a Seattle, Wash., real estate broker named to be ambassador to New Zealand.
0	1	No action has been taken by the Senate on any of those nominations.
0.2375	1	According to Sen. Paul Sarbanes, D-Md., who first raised the issue of political contributions, Zappala and Sembler each contributed more than $100,000 to Republican candidates and causes.
0.271428571428571	1	Mrs. Newman served as chairman of the Washington state Bush for President committee.
0.126666666666667	1	Ambassador David Popper, president of the Academy of Diplomacy, declined to confirm that Gildenhorn and the other three nominees had been rated as unqualified to become ambassadors.
0	1	But he said the academy does offer such ratings, making its judgments based on a comparison of the nominee's biography and the requirements of the job.
0.0974358974358974	1	He said the nonpartisan academy has no objections to political appointees as such but does believe political nominees should be qualified to run a complex embassy and represent the United States abroad with dignity, respect and ability.
0	1	Twenty of 29 ambassadorial nomination made by Bush in the first six months of his administration have gone to non-professionals, many of them large contributors to Republican causes, committee sources said.
0.223529411764706	1	Sarbanes says the appointments are larding the diplomatic corps with amateurs rewarded for purely political services.
0	1	Political throwaways, Sarbanes calls them.
0.0775510204081633	1	I think the time has come, very frankly, to get off the money merry-go-round and ask some very difficult questions, essentially about when extensive political contributions are going to be a sufficient basis to gain an ambassadorial nomination, Sarbanes told the committee last month.
0	1	It's not true in every instance, but in most of these cases you seem to have to be over the $100,000 mark in order to make the consideration list, Sarbanes said.
0	1	Sarbanes says he is not against political ambassadors as such, noting that many of them compiled distinguished records.
0	1	It is not the political ambassadors that are the problem, Sarbanes said.
0	1	It is ambassadors without qualifications.
0.115151515151515	2	Ronald I. Spiers, a veteran U.S. diplomat, will be the new undersecretary-general for General Assembly affairs, the top-ranking American post at the world body, U.N. officials said Tuesday.
0.422222222222222	2	Spiers was ambassador to Pakistan from 1981-83 and has served as ambassador to the Bahamas and Turkey.
0	2	He replaces Joseph Verner Reed, a banker who served in the post from 1987 until leaving last winter to become chief of protocol for the United States.
0	2	Although Spiers' nomination as undersecretary-general for Political and General Assembly Affairs and Secretariat Services had been an open secret for months, Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar announced it was effective as of Tuesday.
0	2	Spiers, 64, is a career foreign service officer, most recently serving as undersecretary of state for management since 1983.
0	2	Spiers has been a member of the U.S. delegation to the United Nations; was director of political affairs for the U.S. Arms Control and Disarmament Agency; and was director of NATO Affairs for the State Department.
0	2	From 1966-69, Spiers was counselor for political affairs in the U.S. Embassy in London.
0	2	In 1969, he became assistant secretary of State in charge of the department's Bureau of Political-Military Affairs.
0.19	2	When the Bahamas became independent from Britain in 1973, Spiers became the first U.S. ambassador to that nation.
0.135714285714286	2	He became charge d'affaires in London in 1974, and was minister of the U.S. Embassy there until 1977, when he was appointed ambassador to Turkey.
0.158333333333333	2	In 1980 he returned to the State Department as director of Intelligence and Research, and was appointed ambassador to Pakistan in 1981.
1	3	President Bush has named career diplomat Deane Hinton as ambassador to Panama, the White House announced Tuesday.
0.095	3	Hinton, currently ambassador to Costa Rica, replaces Ambassador Arthur H. Davis, who was recalled by Bush in protest of what the administration considered the stealing of the Panamanian elections last May by Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega.
0.152	3	Bush sent Davis back to Panama City after the Dec. 20 invasion of Panama by U.S. forces and installation of Guillermo Endara as president.
0	3	Independent observers mostly concluded Endara had won the elections by a hefty margin.
0	3	Bush named Hinton as a recess appointment because Congress is not in session.
0	3	That means Hinton can serve until the end of next year before he must go before the Senate for confirmation.
0	3	The appointment of the 66-year-old Hinton, with his long expierience on Latin American issues, is seen as a signal of the importance Bush is placing on restoring normal relations with Panama.
0	3	Those relations steadily deteriorated after the United States indicted Noriega, once a ally particularly of the U.S. intelligence community, on drug trafficking charges in Florida.
0.38	3	Hinton has been ambassador to Costa Rica since 1987.
0.345454545454545	3	Before that he was ambassador to Pakistan from 1983 to 1987, and ambassador to El Salvador from 1981 to 1983.
0	3	He was assistant secretary of state for economic and business affairs from 1979 to 1981, and before that U.S. representative to the 12-nation European Community, headquartered in Brussels, a State Department adviser on economic affairs, and director and economic counselor of the State Department's Agency for economic Development in Chile and in Guatemala.
0.330434782608696	3	Davis, a former State Department consultant and former ambassador to Paraguay, was sent to Panama by President Reagan in 1986.
0.140740740740741	3	Bush wanted to name his own ambassador and the time was appropriate with the installation of a new government in Panama, said one administration official.
0	3	Officials described Hinton as an experienced Latin America hand and a good person to have in place with the volatile developments in the South American country.
0	3	On Capitol Hill, Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, called Hinton highly qualified for the post because of his wide-ranging experience and expertise in Central America.
0	3	However, Mitchell said he hoped Bush would send the appointment to the Senate after Congress convenes Jan. 23 despite the nature of the recess appointment.
0.575757575757576	4	President Bush is expected to name a female career diplomat as U.S. ambassador to Nicaragua as that country prepares for a new era under President-elect Violeta Chamorro, according to informed sources.
0.330434782608696	4	The sources said Thursday it is virtually certain the appointment will go to Melissa Wells, 57, currently ambassador to Mozambique.
0	4	They said the administration believed a female ambassador could relate better than a man to Mrs. Chamorro, who takes office Wednesday.
0	4	They also said the administration is eager to have more women in key posts.
0	4	Only rarely have U.S. ambassadorships in Latin America gone to women.
0	4	In choosing Ms. Wells, the administration passed over several male career diplomats with long experience in that region, said the sources, who asked not to be identified.
0	4	Ms. Wells, who was born in Estonia, has no prior experience in Latin America.
0	4	Her personnel record indicates she speaks Spanish.
0	4	Wells' name was submitted to the White House by Secretary of State James A. Baker III for the Managua post, and approval is considered 99.9 percent certain, one source said.
0	4	The United States and Nicaragua have not had ambassadors in each other's capitals since July 1988.
0	4	The Sandinista government expelled then-U.S. ambassador Richard Melton and seven other U.S. diplomats on the grounds they were interfering in Nicaragua's internal affairs.
0	4	The Reagan administration retaliated by expelling Nicaraguan Ambassador Carlos Tunnermann and seven of his subordinates from the Nicaraguan embassy here.
0	4	But a new era in U.S.-Nicaraguan relations is expected to open with the inauguration of Mrs. Chamorro, who defeated President Daniel Ortega in elections this February.
0	4	Vice President Dan Quayle and a large congressional delegation are expected to represent Bush at her inaugural.
0.304	4	The administration has asked Congress for $300 million in assistance to Nicaragua, part of which would be used for resettling Contra rebels.
0	4	But the request has been stalled by Senate Democrats, some of whom believe that Eastern Europe has a greater claim on U.S. resources than Nicaragua.
0.11875	4	Wells' nomination as ambassador to Mozambique in 1986 encountered strong opposition from Senate conservatives who held up the appointment for 11 months in protest against U.S. policy toward that country.
0	4	The nomination finally was approved in September 1987.
0	4	Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., a leader of the campaign to hold up Wells' nomination, said he wanted to pressure the administration into dealing with rightist guerrillas opposed to Mozambique's Marxist government.
0	4	Mozambique has since moderated its policies and is now off the U.S. government's list of countries under Marxist rule.
0.407142857142857	5	The Bush administration is expected to name career diplomat Harry Shlaudeman as the first U.S. ambassador to Nicaragua in almost two years, a U.S. official says.
0.19	5	The administration had planned to send another career diplomat, Melissa Wells, to Managua but had a change of heart after concluding she might face a prolonged Senate confirmation fight because she has been a target of conservatives.
0	5	The administration is eager to have an ambassador in Managua quickly because of the delicate political situation there now that U.S.-backed President Violeta Chamorro has taken over after almost 11 years of rule by the leftist Sandinista party.
0	5	Mrs. Chamorro faces the demanding challenges of reviving Nicaragua's bankrupt economy and achieving national reconciliation after long years of warfare.
0.584615384615385	5	The United States has had no ambassador to Nicaragua since July 1988.
0	5	At the time, the Sandinista government expelled Ambassador Richard Melton and seven others at the embassy on grounds they were interfering in the country's internal affairs.
0	5	The Reagan administration retaliated by expelling eight Nicaraguan envoys in Washington, including Ambassador Carlos Tunnermann.
0.223529411764706	5	Shlaudeman, who has served as ambassador to Argentina, Peru, Brazil and Venezuela, is a premier State Department specialist on Latin America and is expected to win easy Senate confirmation.
0	5	He retired from the foreign service a year ago but was called back to duty last fall to serve as a State Department liaison with the Nicaraguan Contra rebels.
0	5	Shlaudeman, who will turn 64 next week, was approached by a senior State Department official weeks ago about going to Managua but said he was not interested.
0.2375	5	He told intimates he would agree to go only if asked personally by President Bush.
0	5	When Bush telephoned him earlier this week, Shlaudeman agreed to the appointment, the U.S. official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Wednesday.
0	5	In addition to his ambassadorial posts, Shlaudeman was the top Latin America aide to President Ford in the mid-1970s and a diplomatic trouble-shooter in Central America under President Reagan.
0	5	The U.S. official said Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., and several of his conservative allies would not assure the administration that they would not delay Wells' nomination.
0.158333333333333	5	When Wells was nominated to be ambassador to Mozambique in late 1986, Helms and his colleagues blocked her appointment for 11 months.
0	5	They took the action as a means of expressing opposition to the Reagan administration's friendship toward Mozambique's Marxist government.
0	6	Once the second man in the U.S. Embassy in Cairo, he also served in Saudi Arabia, two African countries, and a European nation.
0.152	6	His choice for the new job signals the importance the United States attaches to Jordan in terms of inter-Arab politics and the Arab-Israeli dispute.
0	6	Before Egan's appointment became final, he had to go through a grueling test in the U.S. Senate, where Senator Daniel Moynihan, the Zionist Democrat from New York, presided over the hearing that scrutinized the would-be ambassador's credentials and went on to confirm his nomination.
0	6	In his testimony, Egan told the hearing he would work to develop relations between the United States and Jordan and enhance Jordan's role in the peace process.
0	6	He pointed out that Jordan signed a joint agenda with Israel that will presumably culminate in a peace treaty between the two countries.
0	6	His said his top priority in Amman will be to propel the peace process forward and recognize Jordan's energetic role in the effort to bring about a comprehensive Middle East peace.
0	6	Mr. Egan will pay special attention to stability in Jordan, and watch its democratic march and economic development.
0	6	He will also watch Jordan's approach to a number of other issues: human rights, compliance with the sanctions resolution against Iraq, terminating the boycott of U.S. companies doing business with Israel, the potential for foreign investment both in Jordan and elsewhere in the region, and the fight against terrorism.
0	6	Much as I take exception to some of the issues that will engage the new ambassador's attention, I concern myself here with a lecture Moynihan delivered at the confirmation hearing.
0	6	Discussing the West Bank and Gaza, he dismissed as inappropriate the designation attached to them as occupied territories, and asked: If these are occupied territories, who were they occupied by?
0.11875	6	These territories, contended the senator, were never the sovereign domain of anyone; it was Jordan that occupied the West Bank at the founding of the state of Israel.
0	6	What Israel did was to take the West Bank from Jordan the way it took Gaza from Egypt.
0	6	Previously, these territories were part of the British mandate, and before that they fell within the realm of the Ottoman Empire.
0	6	Mr. Moynihan's point, in other words, is that these territories are up for grabs.
0	6	The United States, he noted, never recognized Jordan's sovereignty over the West Bank.
0	6	His bottom line: Israel did not occupy territory that was under another nation's sovereignty.
0	6	This Zionist senator's remarks are not supposed to be Washington's official line.
0	6	However, they do mirror an undeclared U.S. line dictated by the all-powerful Zionist lobby a line that is now all but declared with the bizarre voting stance of the United States toward the UN Security Council resolution condemning the Hebron massacre.
0.584615384615385	7	President Bush, filling a key overseas post, has decided to nominate a former CIA officer as ambassador to China, sources said Wednesday.
0	7	The choice is James R. Lilley, a career intelligence officer who served as CIA station chief in China when Bush headed the U.S. liaison office there in 1974-75.
0.0863636363636364	7	Word of the expected nomination came as Bush's choice to be assistant secretary of state for Latin America, Democratic political consultant Bernard Aronson, ran into objections from several Republican members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, congressional aides said.
0	7	The two senior Republicans on the panel, Sens. Jesse Helms and Richard G. Lugar
0	7	both expressed concern about Aronson's appointment to Secretary of State James A. Baker III, the aides said.
0	7	May Face Tough Questioning
0	7	They said that it appears unlikely the senators would attempt to block Aronson's nomination but said that the former Jimmy Carter aide will face tough questioning in his confirmation hearings.
0.211111111111111	7	Lilley, 60, was born in China, the son of an American oilman working there.
0	7	He has also served on the National Security Council staff, as head of the unofficial U.S. office in Taiwan and as a deputy assistant secretary of state for East Asia.
0	7	He will replace Winston Lord, who has headed the American Embassy in Beijing since 1985.
0.253333333333333	7	For the last three years, Lilley served as U.S. ambassador to South Korea.
0	7	In that job, he was the principal American contact with South Korean leaders during the turbulent period when former President Chun Doo Hwan resigned and the current president, Roh Tae Woo, won a bitterly contested election.
0	7	Returns to Washington
0	7	Lilley left Seoul last month and returned to Washington, hoping to be appointed as assistant secretary of state in charge of U.S. policy in East Asia and the Pacific, sources said.
0	7	However, he failed to get that job, in part because newly appointed Deputy Secretary of State Lawrence S. Eagleburger opposed him, the sources said.
0.158333333333333	7	Eagleburger was said to have been promoting two other candidates Lord and U.S. Ambassador to the Philippines Nicholas Platt for the Asian post.
0	7	Eagleburger and Lord served together as aides to former Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger.
0.844444444444444	8	President Bush has decided to nominate John D. Negroponte, a veteran diplomat who helped direct U.S. aid to Nicaraguan rebels, to the key position of ambassador to Mexico, Administration officials said Thursday.
0.135714285714286	8	Negroponte, a 28-year Foreign Service veteran, served as U.S. ambassador to Honduras from 1981 through 1985, when the CIA was secretly funding the Contras.
0	8	Mexico's leftist opposition party already has criticized the appointment, which has not been formally announced.
0.165217391304348	8	But Bush Administration officials said they are confident that the Mexican government of President Carlos Salinas de Gortari will accept the nomination.
0	8	Can Reject Nomination
0.422222222222222	8	Under diplomatic practice, the White House notifies other governments in advance of its choices for ambassadors.
0.211111111111111	8	The foreign government can reject the nomination, but rejection would be considered an unusual diplomatic slap.
0.1	8	Meanwhile, Bush's choice as assistant secretary of state for Latin America, Democratic political consultant Bernard Aronson, ran into objections from several Republican members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, congressional aides said.
0	8	The two senior Republicans on the panel, Sens. Jesse Helms
0	8	C.) and Richard G. Lugar
0	8	both expressed concern about Aronson's appointment to Secretary of State James A. Baker III, the aides said.
0	8	Helms questioned the appointment of a Democrat to the post, and Lugar expressed concern that Aronson had no experience with the economic issues facing South America, they said.
0	8	The aides said it appears unlikely that the senators will attempt to block Aronson's nomination but that the former aide to President Jimmy Carter will face tough questioning in his confirmation hearings.
0	8	Negroponte created controversy in Honduras as a vigorous proponent of the then-secret Contra effort; and Honduran opposition leaders, who said he acted as though he were the governor of a colony, dubbed him Washington's in the country.
0.108571428571429	8	But he later concluded that it had been a mistake for the Ronald Reagan Administration to aid the rebels secretly without building more public support for its policy in Central America, associates said.
0	8	Negroponte was most recently a deputy to Lt. Gen. Colin L. Powell, President Reagan's last national security adviser, and had been an aide to Henry A. Kissinger, then national security adviser to President Richard M. Nixon, during the Vietnam war in 1970-73.
0	8	He has also worked on negotiations with Mexico on environmental and tuna-fishing issues.
0	8	one of the smartest operators in the business," a former aide said.
0	8	very good at working the bureaucracy."
0	8	State Department officials said that they had expected Mexican leftists to register complaints about the appointment because of Negroponte's support of the Contras but that they are confident that Salinas' government will not object formally.
0	8	will blow a little steam off in the press, but I don't think the Mexican government would dream of rejecting him," one official said.
0	8	don't want to get relations with the Bush Administration off on that footing."
0	8	Negroponte, 49, will succeed Charles Pilliod, an Ohio industrialist.

0.393103448275862	9	Three of President Bush's ambassadorial nominees, whom Democrats said had no qualifications except political connections, won narrow approval Tuesday from the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.
0	9	Sen. Charles S. Robb
0.325714285714286	9	joined the Republican members as the panel first voted, 10 to 9, to send to the Senate floor the nomination of Florida real estate developer Joseph Zappala to be ambassador to Spain.
0.506666666666667	9	Then, in voice votes, the committee approved the equally controversial nominations of Florida real estate developer Marvin Sembler to be ambassador to Australia and Della Newman, a Seattle, Wash., real estate broker, to be ambassador to New Zealand.
0	9	Robb said later that he was troubled over Zappala's thin" qualifications for the job but that he felt he had made an commitment to vote for the nominee when he interviewed him May 11 and did not clearly indicate that he would oppose him.
0	9	Sen. Paul S. Sarbanes
0	9	who led the opposition to the nominations, vowed to carry the fight to the Senate floor.
0	9	looks through this resume wondering why this person has been appointed to this position," Sarbanes said of Zappala.
0.2375	9	answer is to be found in the appendix, which lists the campaign contributions."
0.152	9	Zappala reported to the committee that he contributed $126,000 last year to Republican campaigns and gave $17,900 in the previous two years.
0.490322580645161	9	His prior governmental experience, described on the ambassadorial evaluation form submitted to the committee, consisted mainly of chairing campaign finance committees for President Bush and the Republican Party.
0.95	9	In other action, the committee routinely approved the nomination of Shirley Temple Black to be ambassador to Czechoslovakia.
0.674193548387097	9	It also approved the nominations of Thomas Melady to be ambassador to the Vatican, William Howard Taft IV to be the permanent U.S. representative on the Council of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, Keith L.

0.506666666666667	10	WASHINGTON President Bush plans to name United Nations Ambassador Thomas Pickering as U.S. envoy to India, and appoint the current head of the foreign service to succeed him.
0.370731707317073	10	The White House, according to a U.S. official, hasn't yet informed the Senate, which must confirm the nominations of Mr. Pickering and Foreign Service Director General Edward Perkins, a former U.S. envoy to South Africa.
0	10	With the end of the Cold War, the U.N. is playing an increasingly important role in working to resolve regional disputes.
0	10	It has led efforts to end civil wars in El Salvador and Cambodia, and it also helped monitor elections in Namibia.
0.146153846153846	10	Last Friday, during an unprecedented U.N. Security Council meeting of heads of state, President Bush reaffirmed the U.N.'s leading role in peacemaking.
0	10	The assignment in India could be an important one.
0	10	India and its neighbor Pakistan remain embroiled in a long, bitter feud that has the potential of becoming one of the world's few remaining nuclear standoffs.
0.95	10	Mr. Pickering was one of President Bush's first ambassadorial appointments.
0	10	He served at the U.N. during the time the administration was involved in the delicate negotiations that led to the formation of the coalition against Iraq in the Persian Gulf War and the U.N. sanctions against Saddam Hussein's regime.
0	10	But some senior State Department officials have been irritated by what they call Mr. Pickering's propensity for the media spotlight.
0	10	During the 1980s, when the Reagan administration drew the line against communist-backed insurgences in Central America, Mr. Pickering played an active role in that effort as U.S. envoy to El Salvador.
0.12258064516129	10	Mr. Perkins was the U.S. ambassador to South Africa in 1986, when the U.S. imposed economic sanctions against that nation's white-minority government to pressure it to end apartheid.
0	10	Mr. Perkins, who is black, traveled widely across South Africa during this period, making sure he was seen in black townships, attending church services and funerals, as well as in white communities.

0.457142857142857	2	Major has done himself great damage.

0	2	However, Tory right wingers said last night that they would support Mr Major because there was no credible right-wing candidate.

0.123076923076923	3	As the ruling party, the Tories took just 27 percent of the vote, two percentage points lower than their rating in the polls.
0.237037037037037	3	The results of the local elections showed that the Tories were reduced to the third party nationally, behind the Liberal Democrats and the Labour Party.
0.123076923076923	3	The Labour Party controls 90 local councils, whereas the Conservatives only control 13, with a sharp contrast in strength between the two sides.
0	3	The Liberal Democrats had a net gain of 378 seats.
0	3	Even some former Conservative members of parliament announced publicly to reporters that they would vote for the Liberal Democrats.
0.0842105263157895	3	Of course, this was a measure taken by Tories under circumstances of an inevitable defeat to reduce losses by encouraging constituents, who resent the Tories, to vote for the Liberal Democrats rather than Labour.
0	3	In the deep sorrow of defeat, some Conservatives are secretly feeling happy.
0.228571428571429	3	They resent John Major's leadership, and would most willingly link Major's incompetence and lack of vision with the bitter defeat in the local elections.
0.103225806451613	3	Even before all of the results were known, some Tories openly announced their determination to challenge John Major's position and remove him from office as early as possible.
0.1	3	The right-winger Michael Portillo added salt to the wound by starting a dispute over the European issue, and highlighted John Major's image as a loser who fails to command.
0.103225806451613	3	Obviously, all of these actions were long planned and are aimed at making John Major suffer an even greater defeat in the European Parliament elections scheduled for 9 June.
0	3	Before 9 June, nobody will officially challenge for the position of party leader.
0	3	But he who is in office must suffer the pain of electoral defeat.
0.237037037037037	3	After 9 June, John Major will have to answer for all of the disasters, and it is time to use him as a scapegoat.
0.192	3	John Major is someone who was propped up by Mrs. Thatcher, who supported appointing the mediocre John Major as her successor when she was utterly isolated so that one day she would be able to pull strings from behind the scenes and continue to pursue the Thatcher line.
0.237037037037037	3	Nevertheless, people around John Major seriously pushed him to betray Thatcher's doctrine, while pursuing entirely new policies and affecting John Major's moves.
0	3	For a very long period, right-wingers and left-wingers argued over many domestic and world issues.
0.369230769230769	3	John Major has always been weak and powerless, and vacillates to the left and to the right resulting in his own of honor."
0	3	On the European issue, he stressed the imperative of maintaining the sovereignty, cultural traditions, and life-style of each country of the future European Union, while reflecting the islanders' mind set.
0	3	On the one hand, he expressed the will to join the European family; on the other, he made one big stride closer to the right.
0.384	3	While great skill is needed to have one's bread buttered on both sides, John Major has been relatively stupid in such circumstance.
0	3	When expounding on such concepts, he set out a campaign to to basic values," with an emphasis on citizen self-discipline, taking social responsibility and obligations, and being upright.
0	3	However, one scandal surfaced after another in his cabinet; consequently, British citizens saw how bombastic Major could be and how he failed to know himself.
0	3	The scandals caused Major's reputation to collapse.
0.234146341463415	3	For a long time, John Major has failed to resolve the economic crisis and has seriously jeopardized the interests of British people, who have become poorer with each passing day and suffer from a high rate of unemployment.
0.177777777777778	3	At this critical juncture, John Major went back on promises made during the election campaign by increasing value-added tax on domestic fuel; as a result, things became even harder for the poor.
0	3	He promised to reduce public expenditure, but on the contrary, it rose by 45.5 percent.
0.556521739130435	3	published] John Major has become an expert in making promises," while constituents continue to scorn this dishonest prime minister.
0.426666666666667	3	Many Conservatives believe that John Major is driven by a gambler's mind set.
0	3	At a time when his reputation was waning, he wanted to start an offensive in the arena of difficult world issues, regardless of British national strength.
0	3	This being the case, he wanted to try his luck in Bosnia, as well as policy toward China; however, he was helpless in dealing with domestic economic issues which would only lead Britain to an impasse.
0.412903225806452	3	It will be difficult for John Major to lead the Tories in the next general election; therefore, news spread earlier this year that John Major would be replaced.
0.2	3	The setback which has resulted from defeats in the local elections is heavier than expected.
0.304761904761905	3	To accelerate a leadership reshuffle, Conservatives have spread the opinion that Major is not up to his office."
0	3	However, if politicians from various factions compete for office by taking a laissez-faire attitude, the Tory unity will be jeopardized.
0	3	This being the case, a planned transfer of power, especially the reorganization of the cabinet and the replacement of the party chairman, is necessary.
0.152380952380952	3	When the new party chairman is elected, the question of who will replace John Major will be settled too.
0.290909090909091	3	Word has spread that John Major wants Chris Patten to become Conservative Party chairman; however, this proposal was rejected.
0	3	That should have been a party secret; making public such an inside story would only provide evidence of political reality, namely, many Conservatives did not agree to Chris Patten contending for this position.
0	3	There are no grounds to allow a politician who has lost a previous electoral campaign to canvass votes in the next one under unfavorable electoral circumstances.
0	3	That would only aggravate the Tory's poor image as a party which enjoys little public support and has few talents.
0.08	3	In actual fact, should John Major set out such a line in appointing people, that would only give more evidence of his poor ability, insight, and lack of judgment, as well as his self-knowledge.
0	3	Now, it is just a matter of time until he leaves office; but nobody will let him make arrangements for the transfer of power.
0.266666666666667	3	Work to seek a new leader will be conducted by veteran Tories; how can John Major be qualified for such a task?
0.533333333333333	4	ONE year ago tomorrow, Mr John Major surprised everyone but himself by winning the general election.
0.0941176470588235	4	His honeymoon, after a very personal victory, was short-lived and now he begins the second year of his hard-won term as a deeply unpopular leader who has everything still to prove.
0.064	4	The past 12 months have been hijacked by internal party differences over Europe, by the debacle surrounding UK withdrawal from the exchange rates mechanism of the European Monetary System, and by a continuing, deep recession which has disappointed and alienated many traditional Tory supporters in business.
0	4	Mr Major's anniversary inevitably led yesterday to an outbreak of political point-scoring over the government's record.
0.1	4	While Mr Tony Newton, leader of the Commons, conceded: one pretends that the last year has been easy,' he also claimed that much had been achieved.
0	4	The government's efforts to secure a framework for long-term prosperity was beginning to pay off.
0.103225806451613	4	Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, was joined by 10 frontbench colleagues in launching a counter-attack, involving a detailed and documented indictment of Mr Major's failures.
0.266666666666667	4	He attacked the Tories for building bonfire of pre-election commitments'.
0	4	Tory allegiances in the business world have also been put under immense pressure, though criticism over policy drift and inaction may soften as recession ends.
0	4	Yesterday Sir Michael Angus, president of the Confederation of British Industry, remained cautious but volunteered: I were a betting man I would say we have the embryo of a recovery.'
0.0680851063829787	4	Mr Major can take little comfort from the conclusion, widespread among industrialists, that his greatest achievement in the past year has been Britain's withdrawal from the ERM something which he resisted and over which, in the end, he had no control.
0	4	Most industrialists, however, find it hard to criticise Mr Major as an individual, with many drawing a flattering parallel between his personal qualities and those of his predecessor.
0	4	He still attracts gratitude for the election victory, which was seen despite subsequent problems for the economy as the best result for business.
0.441379310344828	4	But, unlike the previous No 10 occupant, he is seen as a weak leader, with little vision and bereft of a clearly articulated political conviction.
0.15609756097561	4	There is a general perception that, important though Britain's future place in Europe is, the prime minister has been excessively preoccupied with community affairs and associated internal party ructions, to the detriment of the domestic economy.
0.152380952380952	4	Many industrialists are pleased that Mr Major is now attempting to reshape economic strategy in favour of the manufacturing base.

0.237037037037037	5	THE revelation that John Major is capable of candid, blunt and salty language when talking off-the- record to friendly journalists has surprised some people.
0.060377358490566	5	It has even been suggested that the recording of the prime minister's conversation with Michael Brunson, ITN's political editor, in which Major used a variety of four-, six- and eight-letter words to communicate his lack of fondness for certain colleagues, may do him good.
0.177777777777778	5	With luck, it is reckoned, Major's image as a leaden-tongued wimp may undergo correction.
0.152380952380952	5	Major is a gonner, especially after this week's revolt of the wooden-tops in the Christchurch by-election, where a Conservative majority of 23,015 at last year's general election was converted into a 16,427 majority for the Liberal Democrats.
0.16	5	Fifteen months too late, the voters of Christchurch rounded on the Tories with a malignant and squeaky fury.
0	5	In reality, all politicians, not just Major, are far more candid and salty when chatting in private than when speaking in public.
0	5	In public, they have to be careful of what they say, so their utterances achieve a horrible mattness.
0	5	But in private they relax.
0	5	Their syntax disappears.
0	5	Their words become nonsensical.
0	5	They swear and joke and shout.
0	5	It really is a spectacle.
0.188235294117647	5	To show you what I mean, I spoke yesterday to John Major and John Smith.
0.168421052631579	5	Smith, a Scot, is leader of the Labour Party, though not many people know that.
0	5	In the aftermath of Christchurch, where Labour lost its deposit, I wanted to provoke the two Johns into a spot of real soul-searching.
0	5	To guarantee them privacy, I used a signal-scrambler.
0	5	No one could have eavesdropped.
0	5	Their responses were true to form.
0	5	But I have left out the swear-words because the new Financial Times Style Guide states that gratuitous use of expletives or obscenities is discouraged Four-letter expletives will usually be confined to infrequent use in the review pages.'
0	5	I can live with that, though why the artsy-fartsies should receive any dispensation is a puzzle.
0.533333333333333	5	First, I tackled Major.
0.08	5	I said: you read, John, what Olivier Blanchard, Rudiger Dornbusch, Stanley Fischer, Franco Modigliani, Paul A Samuelson and Robert Solow wrote, in just one article, in the FT this week?
0	5	They were describing Europe's lunatic monetary policies and exchange rate arrangements.
0	5	They did not pull their punches.
0	5	I bet you went chalk-white.
0.4	5	why not walk the plank, John?
0.213333333333333	5	You are the most unpopular prime minister since the start of the fourth century.
0	5	Why invite more punishment?
0	5	Unfairly or not, you are drawing the blame for all life's unpleasantnesses, let alone the cock-ups.'
0.64	5	the prime minister replied.
0	5	I mean how did it come about, Michael like, Christchurch, y'know load of let me put it to you the economy, of course I mean, wimpy guy like me.
0	5	But I'm not giving in like that, like On and on it went.
0	5	Then I rang John Smith.
0	5	I told him I had been impressed with his interview with Andrew Marr in The Independent on Thursday, in which he sharpened up his promise to introduce meaty political reforms including a referendum on proportional representation.
0.266666666666667	5	I said: are starting to raise your game, John.
0.0744186046511628	5	Many people will have agreed with your assertion that democracy in Britain is decaying, and that the Tories must be roasted for their arrogance, incompetence, complacency and sharp practices especially their of power and the elimination of opposition'.
0.2	5	But some of your critics still accuse you, John, of laziness and ineffectualness.
0	5	What do you say to that?'
0	5	ye thowless jad,' shouted the Labour leader.
0	5	me o'wit an' sense a life, behint a kist to lie an' sklent.
0	5	Our Stibble-rig was Rab M'Graen, a clever, sturdy fellow, but then he was sae fley'd by his showther gae a keek, an' tumbl'd wi' a wintle.
0.0457142857142857	5	Likewise with political and constitutional reform, Michael, for by the L d, tho' I should beg wi'lyart pow, I'll laugh, an' sing, an' shake my leg, as lang's I dow]' After that, I thought of telephoning Wing-Commander Paddy Ashdown, leader of the Liberal Democrats, to solicit his views on Christchurch.
0	5	But I couldn't raise the energy.
0.106666666666667	6	Last year a biography of Mrs Norma Major or, if we are being old-fashioned, Mrs John Major claimed that the Majors' favourite film was Being There.
0	6	I entirely concur with their choice.
0	6	In case you did not see that marvellous film, this, in essence, was the plot: a man no one knows anything about, a gardener called Chauncey, rises without trace to become, by the end of the film, a serious candidate for the US presidency.
0	6	Chauncey, played by Peter Sellers, utters only mundane sentiments in a halting monotone but this convinces the Republican party's power brokers that he is a sure-fire winner.
0	6	In Chauncey's bromides everyone seems to hear what they want to believe.
0	6	He has a deadly innocence.
0	6	No wonder the Majors liked this film.
0.123076923076923	6	John Major must, at some level, have appreciated the similarity between his own, strangely intangible, rise and that of Chauncey's.
0	6	If he did not see the similarity, that is still more revealing.
0.213333333333333	6	Do not protest that the urban John Major could not identify with a gardener.
0	6	In an interview with Farmers Weekly, a few days ago, Major disclosed an unknown fact: his father was once a farmer.
0	6	Farmers Weekly, you see, had asked Major how he had obvious empathy with agriculture'.
0	6	And Major replied: simple.
0	6	My father was a farmer.
0	6	He lived on a small farm somewhere in Shropshire.'
0.096969696969697	6	Francis Wheen of The Guardian, a keen student of Major's mysterious past, immediately rang 10 Downing Street, which claimed that Major's father farmed near Bromsgrove in 1910.
0.228571428571429	6	As Wheen pointed out, Major was an unresponsive minus 33 years old at that time, and a minor point this Bromsgrove is not in Shropshire.
0.228571428571429	6	This, of course, does not mean that Major made everything up.
0	6	Family folklore is a peculiar thing.
0	6	Yet when I heard about this, my mind immediately went back to an incident a few months ago, when Major visited Pittsburgh, centre of the US steel industry, as part of his American tour.
0	6	I recall that he made a great hit by recounting that his father had been a steelworker in the city.
0	6	A farmer for Farmers Weekly, a Pittsburgh steelworker for the American audience a pattern emerges.
0.16	6	Major's father, and therefore by extension John Major himself, can be all things to all people.
0.336842105263158	6	If John Major were a different sort of politician, this would be a point barely worth making.
0	6	But it does seem all of a piece with Major's approach to wider political issues.
0	6	On the one hand he will appeal to the pro-Europeans in his own party by claiming to want Britain to be at the heart of Europe.
0	6	On the other he is free with insulting references to the European Commission, whenever it is necessary to appeal to an audience of Euro-sceptics.
0.24	6	There are those who will argue that this merely means that Major is a typical democratic politician, that one who wants to become prime minister in a democracy must recognise many constituencies of interest, not just one.
0	6	But that has not been true of Major's most recent Conservative predecessors.
0.114285714285714	6	Margaret Thatcher was notoriously dogmatic, even in public, and so too was Edward Heath, even though he always pretended to be a politician'.
0.103225806451613	6	No, Major's technique is very much his own invention, very much a reflection of his own particular character, itself a product of his unsettled family background.
0	6	His father, Tom Major-Ball, was an itinerant figure, moving from place to place, trying his hand at any number of occupations, including the circus.
0.152380952380952	6	No wonder the young John Major learned the skill of fitting in with prevailing circumstances, no matter how fluctuating.
0	6	The only problem is the old one: you cannot fool all of the people all of the time.
0	6	Except in the movies.

1	7	John Major, who was endorsed by Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher as her successor and heir, was elected today as leader of the Conservative Party and will become prime minister.
0.556521739130435	7	Major fell two votes short of the needed majority, but his opponents conceded defeat and Conservative Party officials declared him elected.

0.08	7	congratulate John Major and thank him for a first-class campaign, fought without rancor or bitterness, which I believe lays the basis for the unity of our party," Heseltine said moments after the vote was announced.
0.64	7	Hurd also quickly conceded.
0.533333333333333	7	Within minutes, Cranley Onslow, chairman of the Conservative Party committee that supervised the election, announced that another ballot was not required and that Major was elected.
0	7	Thatcher left her residence at 10 Downing Street to congratulate Major, who as chancellor of the Exchequer is her next-door neighbor at No. 11.
0	7	Queen Elizabeth II will send for Major and ask him to form a Cabinet after Thatcher has handed in her seals of office at Buckingham Palace on Wednesday morning.
0.152380952380952	7	Major was elected to Parliament in 1979, was appointed foreign secretary and then chancellor of the Exchequer last year.
0.309677419354839	7	He attracted support from prominent figures on the right wing of the Conservative Party, although his friends insisted that Major's own views are more liberal than many supposed.
0	7	He described himself as conservative on economic issues but liberal on social issues.
0	7	Major epitomized the self-reliant, hard-working achiever whom Thatcher encouraged.
0	7	Born March 29, 1943, the son of a circus performer, he left school at 16 and was a laborer and at one time a welfare recipient.
0.145454545454545	7	Major became a banker and a Conservative Party activist and was elected to Parliament in the first Thatcher victory of 1979.
0	7	He was appointed to a junior ministerial post in 1985, then to the No. 2 position at the Exchequer in 1987.
0	7	He emerged as a possible heir-apparent when Thatcher appointed him foreign secretary in July, 1989, and then chancellor of the Exchequer three months later.
0.376470588235294	8	John Major, the 47-year-old chancellor of the exchequer who rose out of one of London's toughest neighborhoods and the unemployment line, was selected Tuesday as Britain's next prime minister.
0.470588235294118	8	Major, whose father was once a circus trapeze artist, was elected leader of the Conservative Party to replace Margaret Thatcher, whose sudden resignation under pressure last week surprised the nation.
0	8	Thatcher formally presents her resignation today to Queen Elizabeth II, who will then ask Major to form a new government.
0.518918918918919	8	The Conservatives' choice of Major, a Thatcher protege, came after a battle pitting him against two other contenders for the party leadership, former Defense Secretary Michael Heseltine and Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd.
0.123076923076923	8	The three-way race took shape last week when Thatcher, stunned by Heseltine's strong showing in the first-round voting for party leader, resigned.
0.182857142857143	8	In the secret, second-round balloting among the 372 Tory members of the House of Commons on Tuesday, Major got 185 votes two shy of the total he needed for an outright victory.
0.252631578947368	8	But as party members began preparing themselves for a Thursday runoff between Major and Heseltine, the runner-up, both Heseltine, with 131 votes, and Hurd, with 56, threw their support to Major.
0	8	Thatcher said she was by Major's victory, adding that he was her personal favorite among the three contenders.
0.685714285714286	8	Major becomes Britain's 18th prime minister and the youngest in this century.
