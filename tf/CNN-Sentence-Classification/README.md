# Convolutional Neural Networks for Sentence Classification(Sentiment Analysis)

The project is a simplified implemention of [ Convolutional Neural Networks for Sentence Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/1408.5882) in Tensorflow with reference to [dennybritz's blog](http://www.wildml.com/2015/12/implementing-a-cnn-for-text-classification-in-tensorflow/),which is a really nice tutorial for CNN applied to NLP.
